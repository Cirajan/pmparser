TI  - Enhanced photocatalytic performance of CdFe(2)O(4)/Al(2)O(3) nanocomposite for 
      dye degradation.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-24834-4 [doi]
AB  - In the present work, CdFe(2)O(4)/Al(2)O(3) magnetic nanocomposite photocatalyst 
      is successfully synthesized by simple sol-gel auto-combustion method. The role of 
      this sample is studied as a photocatalyst. The influence of Al(2)O(3) 
      concentration with CdFe(2)O(4) on the photocatalytic property is also studied. We 
      have considered three weight percentage of Al(2)O(3), 5%, 10%, and 20% with 
      CdFe(2)O(4). All the samples are characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), 
      Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 
      field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron 
      microscopy (TEM) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED), vibrating sample 
      magnetometer (VSM), UV-Visible, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy 
      techniques. The 10% composite sample showed the lower particle size, higher 
      surface area, enhanced porosity, higher saturation magnetization, and 
      considerable band gap as compared to that of 5% and 20% CdFe(2)O(4)/Al(2)O(3) as 
      well as bare CdFe(2)O(4) nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of the sample 
      is evaluated towards the degradation of the xylenol orange (XO) dye under UV 
      light. The degradation process of the dye is monitored spectrophotometrically. 
      The performance in terms of removal efficiency is studied by varying the contact 
      time, dye concentration and amount of catalyst. Among the three concentrations of 
      Al(2)O(3), the 10% weight concentration of Al(2)O(3) with CdFe(2)O(4) is found to 
      be the optimal concentration and showed the higher degradation rate. After 30 min 
      photocatalytic reaction, the degradation rate is 92.29% for 10% 
      CdFe(2)O(4)/Al(2)O(3) and for bare CdFe(2)O(4), it is 85.79%. This work provides 
      a new reference for designing Al(2)O(3)-based spinel ferrite nanocomposites and 
      their role in wastewater management.

TI  - Softness of hydrated salt crystals under deliquescence.
PG  - 1090

AB  - Deliquescence is a first-order phase transition, happening when a salt absorbs 
      water vapor. This has a major impact on the stability of crystalline powders that 
      are important for example in pharmacology, food science and for our environment 
      and climate. Here we show that during deliquescence, the abundant salt sodium 
      sulfate decahydrate, mirabilite (Na(2)SO(4)·10H(2)O), behaves differently than 
      anhydrous salts. Using various microscopy techniques combined with Raman 
      spectroscopy, we show that mirabilite crystals not only lose their facets but 
      also become soft and deformable. As a result, microcrystals of mirabilite 
      simultaneously behave crystalline-like in the core bulk and liquid-like at the 
      surface. Defects at the surface can heal at a speed much faster than the 
      deliquescence rate by the mechanism of visco-capillary flow over the surface. 
      While magnesium sulfate hexahydrate (MgSO(4)⋅6H(2)O) behaves similarly during 
      deliquescence, a soft and deformable state is completely absent for the anhydrous 
      salts sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium sulfate thenardite (Na(2)SO(4)). The 
      results highlight the effect of crystalline water, and its mobility in the 
      crystalline structure on the observed softness during deliquescence. Controlled 
      hydrated salts have potential applications such as thermal energy storage, where 
      the key parameter is relative humidity rather than temperature.

AB  - Viruses are increasingly recognised as important components of the human 
      microbiome, fulfilling numerous ecological roles including bacterial predation, 
      immune stimulation, genetic diversification, horizontal gene transfer, microbial 
      interactions, and augmentation of metabolic functions. However, our current view 
      of the human gut virome is tainted by previous sequencing requirements that 
      necessitated the amplification of starting nucleic acids. In this study, we 
      performed an original longitudinal analysis of 40 healthy control, 19 Crohn's 
      disease, and 20 ulcerative colitis viromes over three time points without an 
      amplification bias, which revealed and highlighted the interpersonal 
      individuality of the human gut virome. In contrast to a 16 S rRNA gene analysis 
      of matched samples, we show that α- and β-diversity metrics of unamplified 
      viromes are not as efficient at discerning controls from patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, we explored the intrinsic properties of 
      unamplified gut viromes and show there is considerable interpersonal variability 
      in viral taxa, infrequent longitudinal persistence of intrapersonal viruses, and 
      vast fluctuations in the abundance of temporal viruses. Together, these 
      properties of unamplified faecal viromes confound the ability to discern disease 
      associations but significantly advance toward an unbiased and accurate 
      representation of the human gut virome.

AB  - To address the growing demand for more elastic sutures free from unwanted knot 
      loosening, we fabricated an absorbable monofilament suture from 
      poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) and subjected it to physical 
      property characterization and performance evaluation (in vitro and in vivo 
      degradability tests and a porcine abdominal wall suture test). As this flexible, 
      highly stretchable, and difficult-to-untie suture exhibited additional advantages 
      of small knot size and medium to long-term bioabsorbability, it was concluded to 
      be a safe alternative to existing monofilament sutures, with far-reaching 
      potential applications.

TI  - Causes and length of stay of readmission among individuals with traumatic spinal 
      cord injury: a prospective observational cohort study.
LID - 10.1038/s41393-023-00874-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary conditions may reduce function and participation in 
      individuals with chronic Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). The knowledge of reasons for 
      readmission to the hospital may be enlightening to prevent them and remodel the 
      health services. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective observational study of all 
      consecutive readmissions of persons with SCI after rehabilitation completion. 
      OBJECTIVES: To explore the characteristics of individuals with SCI readmitted to 
      the hospital, the reasons for readmissions and the burden on hospitalization in 
      terms of length of stay (LoS) for different conditions. SETTING: 31 Italian 
      specialized SCI centers. METHODS: Data on people with traumatic SCI readmitted to 
      SCI centers were recorded about: age, sex, SCI level and severity group, 
      geographical origin, readmission causes, clinical interventions during 
      hospitalization, LoS and discharge destination. Linear and multiple logistic 
      regression analyses were performed considering LoS (days) as dependent variable 
      for correlations with independent variables. All tests were two-sided. RESULTS: 
      Among 1039 persons with traumatic SCI enrolled (mean age 46, males 85%, 
      tetraplegia 43%), 59.09% of the readmissions were caused by urological problems, 
      39.74% by pressure injury and 35.41% by spasticity (68% readmitted for ≥2 causes, 
      associated with longer LoS). The mean LoS was 48 days: pressure injury, 
      rehabilitative needs, sexual, bowel, and pain problems were associated with 
      longer and urological problems with shorter LoS. People from the South of the 
      country were frequently (68%) readmitted to the northern centers. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Urological problems, pressure injury and spasticity were the most frequent causes 
      of re-hospitalization in individuals with traumatic SCI. The migration trend 
      seeking SCI-specific treatments suggests geographic areas to which health care 
      organizations need to pay more attention.

AB  - Vaginal inflammation increases the risk for sexual HIV-1 transmission but 
      underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study we assessed the impact of 
      immune activation on HIV-1 susceptibility of primary human vaginal Langerhans 
      cells (LCs). Vaginal LCs isolated from human vaginal tissue expressed a broad 
      range of TLRs and became activated after exposure to both viral and bacterial TLR 
      ligands. HIV-1 replication was restricted in immature vaginal LCs as only low 
      levels of infection could be detected. Notably, activation of immature vaginal 
      LCs by bacterial TLR ligands increased HIV-1 infection, whereas viral TLR ligands 
      were unable to induce HIV-1 replication in vaginal LCs. Furthermore, mature 
      vaginal LCs transmitted HIV-1 to CD4 T cells. This study emphasizes the role for 
      vaginal LCs in protection against mucosal HIV-1 infection, which is abrogated 
      upon activation. Moreover, our data suggest that bacterial STIs can increase the 
      risk of HIV-1 acquisition in women.

AB  - Increasing antimicrobial resistance in uropathogens is a clinical challenge to 
      emergency physicians as antibiotics should be selected before an infecting 
      pathogen or its antibiotic resistance profile is confirmed. We created a 
      predictive model for antibiotic resistance of uropathogens, using machine 
      learning (ML) algorithms. This single-center retrospective study evaluated 
      patients diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) in the emergency department 
      (ED) between January 2020 and June 2021. Thirty-nine variables were used to train 
      the model to predict resistance to ciprofloxacin and the presence of urinary 
      pathogens' extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The model was built with 
      Gradient-Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) with performance evaluation. Also, we 
      visualized feature importance using SHapely Additive exPlanations. After two-step 
      customization of threshold adjustment and feature selection, the final model was 
      compared with that of the original prescribers in the emergency department (ED) 
      according to the ineffectiveness of the antibiotic selected. The probability of 
      using ineffective antibiotics in the ED was significantly lowered by 20% in our 
      GBDT model through customization of the decision threshold. Moreover, we could 
      narrow the number of predictors down to twenty and five variables with high 
      importance while maintaining similar model performance. An ML model is 
      potentially useful for predicting antibiotic resistance improving the 
      effectiveness of empirical antimicrobial treatment in patients with UTI in the 
      ED. The model could be a point-of-care decision support tool to guide clinicians 
      toward individualized antibiotic prescriptions.

AB  - Palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation has proven to be a powerful 
      method for the preparation of a wide variety of chiral molecules. However, the 
      catalytic and atroposelective allylic alkylation is still rare and challenging, 
      especially for biaryl substrates. Herein, we report the palladium-catalyzed 
      desymmetric and atroposelective allylation, in which the palladium complex with a 
      chiral phosphoramidite ligand enables desymmetrization of nucleophilic 
      2-arylresorcinols in a highly enantioselective manner. With the aid of the 
      secondary kinetic resolution effect, a wide variety of substrates containing a 
      hydroxymethyl group at the bottom aromatic ring are able to provide O-allylated 
      products up to 98:2 er. Computational studies show an accessible quadrant of the 
      allylpalladium complex and provide three plausible transition states with intra- 
      or intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The energetically favorable transition state 
      is in good agreement with the observed enantioselectivity and suggests that the 
      catalytic reaction would proceed with an intramolecular hydrogen bond.

TI  - Hydrofoil-like legs help stream mayfly larvae to stay on the ground.
PG  - 325-336
LID - 10.1007/s00359-023-01620-2 [doi]
AB  - Adaptations to flow have already been in the focus of early stream research, but 
      till today morphological adaptations of stream insects are hardly understood. 
      While most previous stream research focused on drag, the effects of lift on 
      ground-living stream insects have been often overlooked. Stream mayfly larvae 
      Ecdyonurus sp. graze on algae on top of the stones and therefore inhabit current 
      exposed places in streams. They have a dorso-ventrally flattened body shape, 
      which is known to reduce drag. However, this body shape enhances lift too, 
      increasing the danger for the animal of getting detached from the substrate. 
      Using microscopic techniques, 3D-printing, and drag and lift measurements in a 
      wind tunnel, our experiments show that the widened femora of Ecdyonurus sp. can 
      generate negative lift, contributing to counterbalance the (positive) lift of the 
      overall body shape. The larvae can actively regulate the amount of lift by 
      adjusting the femur's tilt or optimizing the distance to the ground. This shows 
      that morphological adaptations of benthic stream insects can be very elaborate 
      and can reach far beyond adaptations of the overall body shape. In the presented 
      case, Ecdyonurus sp. takes advantage of the flow to overcome the flow's 
      challenges.

TI  - AI-assisted identification of intrapapillary capillary loops in magnification 
      endoscopy for diagnosing early-stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a 
      preliminary study.
LID - 10.1007/s11517-023-02777-3 [doi]
AB  - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common histological 
      types of esophageal cancers. It can seriously affect public health, particularly 
      in Eastern Asia. Early diagnosis and effective therapy of ESCC can significantly 
      help improve patient prognoses. The visualization of intrapapillary capillary 
      loops (IPCLs) under magnification endoscopy (ME) can greatly support the 
      identification of ESCC occurrences by endoscopists. This paper proposes an 
      artificial-intelligence-assisted endoscopic diagnosis approach using deep 
      learning for localizing and identifying IPCLs to diagnose early-stage ESCC. An 
      improved Faster region-based convolutional network (R-CNN) with a polarized 
      self-attention (PSA)-HRNetV2p backbone was employed to automatically detect IPCLs 
      in ME images. In our study, 2887 ME with blue laser imaging (ME-BLI) images of 
      246 patients and 493 ME with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) images of 81 patients 
      were collected from multiple hospitals and used to train and test our detection 
      model. The ME-NBI images were used as the external testing set to verify the 
      generalizability of the model. The experimental evaluation revealed that the 
      proposed method achieved a recall of 79.25%, precision of 75.54%, F1-score of 
      0.764 and mean average precision (mAP) of 74.95%. Our method outperformed other 
      existing approaches in our evaluation. It can effectively improve the accuracy of 
      ESCC detection and provide a useful adjunct to the assessment of early-stage ESCC 
      for endoscopists.

AB  - The principal target of this work is to compute the optimal tilt angle (OTA) for 
      Photovoltaic (PV) panels. To perform this task, comprehensive simulations are 
      done starting from altering the tilt angle (TA) daily, to use one fixed TA for 
      all the year. The mathematical models for extra-terrestrial radiation (ETR) of 
      both horizontal and inclined surfaces are presented firstly. At a later stage, 
      the optimization formulation for the maximizing the solar radiation (SR) is 
      adapted, and then the daily, monthly, seasonally, half-yearly and optimal fixed 
      TAs are obtained. Although, the daily OTA produces the maximum SR, it is costly 
      and impractical. It is found that altering the TA twice a year at optimal values 
      that are computed as 5° and 50° for Suez city, gives the best results that are 
      very near to the daily altering of the OTA. The difference between the two 
      methods is 1.56% which is very small. Also, the two OTAs has SR better than that 
      of the fixed OTA which is 28° by 7.77%. Also, it is found that the yearly fixed 
      OTA (28°) is nearly equal to the latitude angle of Suez city which is 30°. The 
      two OTAs method of this paper is different from the commonly used method that 
      suggests two TAs. The first TA is used for winter months which is obtained by 
      adding 15° to the latitude angle while the second TA is obtained by subtracting 
      15° from the latitude angle for the summer months. This commonly used method 
      produces lesser SR than the two OTAs method of this paper. The theoretical work 
      has been proved by an experimental work on two PV systems constructed at 25° and 
      30° TAs. The results of the experimental work agree with the theoretical results.

AB  - With the technological advancement in recent years and the widespread use of 
      magnetism in every sector of the current technology, a search for a low-cost 
      magnetic material has been more important than ever. The discovery of magnetism 
      in alternate materials such as metal chalcogenides with abundant atomic 
      constituents would be a milestone in such a scenario. However, considering the 
      multitude of possible chalcogenide configurations, predictive computational 
      modeling or experimental synthesis is an open challenge. Here, we recourse to a 
      stacked generalization machine learning model to predict magnetic moment (µB) in 
      hexagonal Fe-based bimetallic chalcogenides, Fe(x)A(y)B; A represents Ni, Co, Cr, 
      or Mn, and B represents S, Se, or Te, and x and y represent the concentration of 
      respective atoms. The stacked generalization model is trained on the dataset 
      obtained using first-principles density functional theory. The model achieves 
      MSE, MAE, and R(2) values of 1.655 (µB)(2), 0.546 (µB), and 0.922 respectively on 
      an independent test set, indicating that our model predicts the compositional 
      dependent magnetism in bimetallic chalcogenides with a high degree of accuracy. A 
      generalized algorithm is also developed to test the universality of our proposed 
      model for any concentration of Ni, Co, Cr, or Mn up to 62.5% in bimetallic 
      chalcogenides.

TI  - Virulence factors of Gram-negative bacteria from free-ranging Amazon river 
      dolphins (Inia geoffrensis).
LID - 10.1007/s10482-023-01812-5 [doi]
AB  - Freshwater cetaceans play a significant role as sentinel animals, providing 
      important data on animal species and aquatic ecosystem health. They also may 
      serve as potential reservoirs of emerging pathogens and host virulence genes in 
      their microbiota. In this study, we evaluated virulence factors produced by 
      Gram-negative bacteria recovered from individuals belonging to two populations of 
      free-ranging Amazon river dolphins (Inia geoffrensis). A total of 132 isolates 
      recovered from the oral cavity, blowhole, genital opening and rectum of 21 river 
      dolphins, 13 from Negro River and 8 from Tapajós River, Brazil, were evaluated 
      for the production of virulence factors, such as biofilms and exoproducts 
      (proteases, hemolysins and siderophores), in planktonic and biofilm forms. In 
      planktonic form, 81.1% (107/132) of the tested bacteria of free-ranging Amazon 
      river dolphins were able to produce virulence factors, with 44/132 (33.4%), 
      65/132 (49,2%) and 54/132 (40,9%) positive for protease, hemolysin and 
      siderophore production, respectively. Overall, 57/132 (43.2%) of the isolates 
      produced biofilms and, under this form of growth, 66/132 (50%), 88/132 (66.7%) 
      and 80/132 (60.6%) of the isolates were positive for protease, hemolysin and 
      siderophore production. In general, the isolates showed a higher release of 
      exoproducts in biofilm than in planktonic form (P < 0.001). The present findings 
      show that Amazon river dolphins harbor potentially pathogenic bacteria in their 
      microbiota, highlighting the importance of monitoring the micro-organisms from 
      wild animals, as they may emerge as pathogens for humans and other animals.

TI  - Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition: Potential Target of Doxorubicin-Induced 
      Cardiotoxicity.
LID - 10.1007/s40256-023-00573-w [doi]
AB  - The use of chemotherapeutic agents is becoming more frequent as the proportion of 
      new oncology patients increases worldwide, with prolonged survival after 
      treatment. As one of the most popular chemotherapy drugs, doxorubicin plays a 
      substantial role in the treatment of tumors. Unfortunately, the use of 
      doxorubicin is associated with several adverse effects, particularly severe 
      cardiotoxicity that can be life-threatening, which greatly limits its clinical 
      use. For decades, scientists have tried to explore many cardioprotective agents 
      and therapeutic approaches, but their efficacy remains controversial, and some 
      drugs have even brought about significant adverse effects. The concrete molecular 
      mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is still to be unraveled, yet 
      endothelial damage is gradually being identified as an important mechanism 
      triggering the development and progression of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. 
      Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a fundamental process regulating 
      morphogenesis in multicellular organisms, is recognized to be associated with 
      endothelial damage repair and acts as an important factor in the progression of 
      cardiovascular diseases, tumors, and rheumatic immune diseases. Mounting evidence 
      suggests that endothelial-mesenchymal transition may play a non-negligible role 
      in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. In this paper, we reviewed the molecular 
      mechanisms and signaling pathways of EndMT and outlined the molecular mechanisms 
      of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and the current therapeutic advances.

TI  - Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived TGFBI attenuates 
      streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus by inhibiting T-cell 
      proliferation.
LID - 10.1007/s13577-023-00868-9 [doi]
AB  - MSCs have been demonstrated to have a great benefit for type 1 diabetes mellitus 
      (T1DM) due to their strong immunosuppressive and regenerative capacity. However, 
      the comprehensive mechanism is still unclear. Our previous study indicated that 
      transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) is highly expressed in human 
      umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (hUC-MSCs), which are 
      also implicated in T1DM. In this study, we found that infusion of TGFBI knockdown 
      hUC-MSCs displayed impaired therapeutic effects in T1DM mice and decreased 
      immunosuppressive capability. TGFBI knockdown hUC-MSCs could increase the 
      proportion of T-cell infiltration while increasing the expression of IFN-gamma 
      and interleukin-17A in the spleen. In addition, we also revealed that 
      hUC-MSC-derived TGFBI could repress activated T-cell proliferation by interfering 
      with G1/S checkpoint CyclinD2 expression. Our results demonstrate that TGFBI 
      plays a critical role in MSC immunologic regulation. TGFBI could be a new 
      immunoregulatory molecule controlling MSC function for new treatments of T1DM.

TI  - Zinc-Contained Alloy as a Robustly-Adhered Interfacial Lattice Locking Layer for 
      Planar and Stable Zinc Electrodeposition.
PG  - e2211961
LID - 10.1002/adma.202211961 [doi]
AB  - Stable zinc (Zn)/electrolyte interface is critical for developing rechargeable 
      aqueous Zn-metal batteries (AZBs) with long-term stability, which requires the 
      dense and stable Zn electrodeposition. Herein, we construct an interfacial 
      lattice locking (ILL) layer via the electro-co-deposition of Zn and Cu onto the 
      Zn electrodes. The ILL layer shows a low lattice misfit (δ = 0.036) with Zn (002) 
      plane and selectively locks the lattice orientation of Zn deposits, enabling the 
      epitaxial growth of Zn deposits layer by layer. Benefiting from the unique 
      orientation-guiding and robustly-adhered properties, the ILL layer enables the 
      symmetric Zn||Zn cells to achieve an ultra-long lifespan of > 6000 h at 
      1 mA/cm(2) and 1 mAh/cm(2) , a low overpotential (65 mV) at 10 mAh/cm(2) , and a 
      stable Zn plating/stripping for > 90 h at an ultrahigh Zn discharge depth 
      (DOD(Zn) = ∼85%). Even with a limited Zn supply and a high current density 
      (8.58 mA/cm(2) ), the ILL@Zn||Ni-doped MnO(2) cells could still survive for > 
      2300 cycles. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Achieving net-zero emissions targets: An analysis of long-term scenarios using an 
      integrated assessment model.
LID - 10.1111/nyas.14970 [doi]
AB  - More than 100 countries have communicated or adopted new Nationally Determined 
      Contributions (NDCs) and net-zero target pledges. We investigate the impact on 
      global, national, sectoral, and individual greenhouse gas emissions projections 
      under different scenarios based on the announced NDCs and net-zero pledges using 
      the IMAGE integrated assessment model. Our results show that while the net-zero 
      pledges, if implemented, could be an important step forward, they are still not 
      enough to achieve the Paris Agreement goals of well below 2°C and preferably 
      1.5°C by the end of the century. Still, our net-zero scenarios project 
      significant all-sector decarbonization, in particular, electricity; however, 
      certain sectors like industry and transport prove hard to completely abate.

TI  - HLA-DQ eplet mismatch load may identify kidney transplant patients eligible for 
      tacrolimus withdrawal without donor-specific antibody formation after mesenchymal 
      stromal cell therapy.
LID - 10.1111/tan.15008 [doi]
AB  - Recently, the randomized phase-II Triton study demonstrated that mesenchymal 
      stromal cell (MSC) therapy facilitated early tacrolimus withdrawal in living 
      donor kidney transplant recipients. The current sub-study analyzed formation of 
      de novo donor-specific HLA antibodies (dnDSA) in the context of the degree of HLA 
      eplet mismatches. At the time of protocol biopsy at 6 months, 7/29 patients (24%) 
      in the MSC group and 1/27 patient (3.7%) in the control group had developed 
      dnDSA. In the MSC group, all dnDSA were anti-HLA-DQ; two patients had anti-DQ 
      alone and five patients combined with anti-class I, HLA-DR or -DP. Despite excess 
      dnDSA formation in the MSC-arm of the study, the evolution of eGFR (CKD-EPI) and 
      proteinuria were comparable 2 years posttransplant. All dnDSA were 
      complement-binding and three patients had antibody-mediated rejection in the 
      protocol biopsy, but overall rejection episodes were not increased. Everolimus 
      had to be discontinued in nine patients because of toxicity, and tacrolimus was 
      reintroduced in six patients because of dnDSA formation. The HLA-DQ eplet 
      mismatch load independently associated with dnDSA (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.07 
      per eplet mismatch, p = 0.008). A threshold of ≥11 HLA-DQ eplet mismatches 
      predicted subsequent dnDSA in all 11 patients in the MSC group, but specificity 
      was low (44%). Further research is warranted to explore HLA molecular mismatch 
      load as a biomarker to guide personalized maintenance immunosuppression in kidney 
      transplantation.

TI  - Calculation of the contribution of water to calcium intake in low- and 
      middle-income countries.
LID - 10.1111/nyas.14973 [doi]
AB  - Dietary calcium intake is low in many countries, particularly in low- and 
      middle-income countries (LMICs). Water is often overlooked as a source of dietary 
      calcium despite it being universally consumed and providing good calcium 
      bioavailability. Our objective was to assess water distribution systems in LMICs 
      and to develop a formula to simulate the contribution of different water sources 
      to calcium availability. We calculated the contribution of drinking water 
      considering different calcium concentration levels to estimate total calcium 
      availability. We consider a country's households' access to drinking water 
      sources and the distribution of the country's population by age and gender. 
      Calcium availability could be increased by an average of 49 mg of calcium per 
      person per day in the 62 countries assessed if calcium in drinking water was 
      considered. In 22 (31%) of the countries studied, 80% of households are supplied 
      by water sources that could increase calcium availability. Improving calcium 
      concentration in water could be considered as a strategy in LMICs to slightly 
      improve calcium availability.

TI  - Ethical challenges in caring for healthy older adults: Qualitative perspectives.
PG  - 9697330221081953
LID - 10.1177/09697330221081953 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthy aging is one of the essential aspects of a health promotion 
      program in the elderly. AIM: Exploring ethical challenges in healthy elderly care 
      from the perspective of nurses, older adults, and families in the Iranian 
      context. RESEARCH DESIGN: This qualitative study was conducted using a content 
      analysis approach in 4 health centers in northeastern Iran from 2017 to 2019. 
      Semi-structured interviews, observation, review of elderly files, and focus 
      groups were used to collect data. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The ethics committee of 
      the university approved this study in Iran. This study adhered to the principles 
      of the Helsinki Declaration. Ethical principles autonomy, confidentiality, and 
      anonymity were considered for the participants. Participants were informed about 
      the purpose of the study and submitted written informed consent regarding their 
      participation. FINDINGS: The central theme was: An unfair approach to caring for 
      healthy older adults. The three categories were as follows: Forgotten human care, 
      disrespect, and lack of a meaningful and trustworthy relationship. The 14 
      subcategories highlighted the ethical challenges of healthy aging care in health 
      centers. DISCUSSION: The findings showed that due to nurses' unfamiliarity with 
      the concept of healthy aging, older adults are discriminated against in care 
      centers. Creating a standard care program for healthy older adults ensures that 
      ethical principles are followed for these clients. CONCLUSION: Various individual 
      and organizational factors lead to an unfair approach to caring for healthy 
      elderly in health centers. The following factors can help improve the care of 
      healthy aging and reduce ethical challenges in this area: Introducing nurses to 
      the concept of healthy old age and its dimensions, creating a community-based 
      approach in health centers, prioritizing health issues over health issues, 
      Involvement of families and older adults in needs assessment-goal 
      setting-implementation and evaluation of health services, and design of home 
      visit programs to provide services to healthy elderly.

TI  - Radiographic predictors of occult intracranial involvement in olfactory 
      neuroblastoma patients.
LID - 10.1002/alr.23145 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional management of olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) includes 
      margin negative resection with removal of cribriform plate, dura, and olfactory 
      bulb, regardless of intracranial disease. This approach may be over-treating 
      certain patients. Our investigation examines risk factors associated with occult 
      intracranial disease to optimize therapeutic outcomes. METHODS: This 
      retrospective, multi-institutional cohort study examined clinical covariates 
      associated with occult intracranial involvement. Patient demographics, staging, 
      Hyam's grade and pathologic involvement of dura, olfactory bulb/tract and brain 
      were collected. Diagnostic imaging was reviewed. Positive and negative predictive 
      value (NPV) were estimated along with effect size estimates. Cox hazard 
      regression examined associations with overall (OS) and disease-free survival 
      (DFS). RESULTS: 224 subjects with new diagnoses of ONB (2005-2021) were 
      identified. Skull base bone involvement on computed tomography (CT) had the 
      highest NPV for pathologic dura (88.0%), olfactory bulb (88%), and brain 
      involvement (97.3%). Hyam's grade category was significantly associated with 
      dural involvement (φ(C) = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.42). Subjects without radiologic 
      skull base involvement (n = 66) had pathologic positivity of 12.1%. Within this 
      subgroup, Hyam's grade was clinically significant for dural positivity (φ = 0.34; 
      95% CI: -0.12, 0.71) with 28.6% involvement in high grade tumors. Neither 
      clinical nor pathologic positivity of intracranial structures were associated 
      with significantly different OS or DFS. CONCLUSIONS: Both CT and MRI had 
      reasonably good NPV for involvement of dura and olfactory bulb. Higher Hyam's 
      grade was associated with dural involvement. Patients with low-grade tumors not 
      involving the skull base may be suitable for avoiding skull base resection, 
      however further investigation is warranted. This article is protected by

TI  - Prevalence and significance of relative apical sparing in aortic stenosis: 
      insights from an echo and cardiovascular magnetic resonance study of patients 
      referred for surgical aortic valve replacement.
LID - jead032 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ehjci/jead032 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aims to assess the prevalence of relative apical sparing pattern 
      (RASP) in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), referred for 
      surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR), to evaluate its significance, possible 
      relation to amyloid deposition, and persistence after surgery. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Prospective study of 150 consecutive patients [age 73 (interquartile 
      range: 68-77), 51% women], with severe symptomatic AS referred to surgical AVR. 
      All patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) before surgery. RASP was 
      defined by [average apical longitudinal strain (LS)/(average basal LS + average 
      mid LS)] > 1 by echocardiography. AVR was performed in 119 (79.3%) patients. Both 
      Congo red and sodium sulphate-Alcian blue (SAB) stain were used to exclude 
      amyloid on septal myocardial biopsy. LV remodelling and tissue characterization 
      parameters were compared in patients with and without RASP. Deformation pattern 
      was re-assessed at 3-6 months after AVR.RASP was present in 23 patients (15.3%). 
      There was no suspicion of amyloid at pre-operative CMR [native T1 value 1053 ms 
      (1025-1076 ms); extracellular volume (ECV) 28% (25-30%)]. None of the patients 
      had amyloid deposition at histopathology. Patients with RASP had significantly 
      higher pre-operative LV mass and increased septal wall thickness. They also had 
      higher N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels [1564 
      (766-3318) vs. 548 (221-1440) pg/mL, P = 0.010], lower LV ejection fraction (53.7 
      ± 10.5 vs. 60.5 ± 10.2%, P = 0.005), and higher absolute late gadolinium 
      enhancement (LGE) mass [9.7 (5.4-14.1) vs. 4.8 (1.9-8.6) g, P = 0.016] at CMR. 
      Follow-up evaluation after AVR revealed RASP disappearance in all except two of 
      the patients. CONCLUSION: RASP is not specific of cardiac amyloidosis. It may 
      also be found in severe symptomatic AS without amyloidosis, reflecting advanced 
      LV disease, being mostly reversible after surgery.

TI  - Spatial relationship between mitral valve and ventricular septum assessed by 
      resting echocardiography to diagnose left ventricular outflow tract obstruction 
      in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

AB  - AIMS: Echocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction 
      (LVOTO) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) often requires extensive provocative 
      manoeuvers. We investigated, whether echocardiography-derived parameters obtained 
      at rest can aid to determine the presence of LVOTO in persons with HCM. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with HCM admitted to a referral centre 
      underwent standardized transthoracic echocardiographic examination including 
      provocative manoeuvers. Under resting conditions, the length of mitral leaflets 
      and distances between mitral valve coordinates and ventricular walls were blindly 
      measured in parasternal long axis (PLAX) and apical three-chamber (3ch) views, 
      both at early and late systole. Among 142 patients (mean age 59 ± 13 years, 42% 
      women), 68 (42%) had resting or provocable LVOTO with maximal LVOT gradients 
      ≥30 mmHg. Late-systolic distance between mitral leaflet tip and ventricular 
      septum (TIS) was measurable in 137 participants (96%) in 3ch view and 
      independently associated with LVOTO in multivariable logistic regression 
      analysis. The area under the ROC curve of TIS for the identification of LVOTO was 
      0.91 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-0.96]. TIS ≤ 14 mm yielded 97% 
      sensitivity and 57% specificity regarding LVOTO. TIS >14 mm ruled out LVOTO with 
      a negative predictive value of 95%. TIS ≤9 mm ruled in LVOTO with a positive 
      predictive value of 92% (sensitivity 73%, specificity 95%). Among 43 patients 
      with TIS between 10 and 14 mm, 35% had LVOTO. CONCLUSION: In our study, the novel 
      echocardiographic parameter TIS showed high negative and positive predictive 
      values for LVOTO in HCM. These exploratory results await confirmation in larger 
      collectives and prospective investigations.

TI  - Unpaired low-dose computed tomography image denoising using a progressive 
      cyclical convolutional neural network.
LID - 10.1002/mp.16331 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reducing the radiation dose from computed tomography (CT) can 
      significantly reduce the radiation risk to patients. However, low-dose CT (LDCT) 
      suffers from severe and complex noise interference that affects subsequent 
      diagnosis and analysis. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown superior 
      performance in LDCT image-denoising tasks. However, most methods require many 
      normal-dose and low-dose CT image pairs, which are difficult to obtain in 
      clinical applications. Unsupervised methods, on the other hand, are more general. 
      PURPOSE: Deep learning methods based on GAN networks have been widely used for 
      unsupervised LDCT denoising, but the additional memory requirements of the model 
      also hinder its further clinical application. To this end, we propose a simpler 
      multi-stage denoising framework trained using unpaired data, the progressive 
      cyclical convolutional neural network (PCCNN), which can remove the noise from CT 
      images in latent space. METHODS: Our proposed PCCNN introduces a noise transfer 
      model that transfers noise from LDCT to normal-dose CT (NDCT), denoised CT images 
      generated from unpaired CT images, and noisy CT images. The denoising framework 
      also contains a progressive module that effectively removes noise through 
      multi-stage wavelet transforms without sacrificing high-frequency components such 
      as edges and details. RESULTS: Compared with seven LDCT denoising algorithms, we 
      perform a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the experimental results and 
      perform ablation experiments on each network module and loss function. On the 
      AAPM dataset, compared with the contrasted unsupervised methods, our denoising 
      framework has excellent denoising performance increasing the peak signal-to-noise 
      ratio (PSNR) from 29.622 to 30.671, and the structural similarity index (SSIM) 
      was increased from 0.8544 to 0.9199. The PCCNN denoising results were relatively 
      optimal and statistically significant. In the qualitative result comparison, 
      PCCNN without introducing additional blurring and artifacts, the resulting image 
      has higher resolution and complete detail preservation, and the overall 
      structural texture of the image is closer to NDCT. In visual assessments, PCCNN 
      achieves a relatively balanced result in noise suppression, contrast retention, 
      and lesion discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive experimental validation shows 
      that our scheme achieves reconstruction results comparable to supervised learning 
      methods and has performed well in image quality and medical diagnostic 
      acceptability.

      Engineering.

AB  - Articular cartilage defects caused by traumatic injury rarely heal spontaneously 
      and predispose into post-traumatic osteoarthritis. In the current autologous 
      cell-based treatments the regenerative process is often hampered by the poor 
      regenerative capacity of adult cells and the inflammatory state of the injured 
      joint. The lack of ideal treatment options for cartilage injuries motivated us to 
      tissue engineer a cartilage tissue which would be more resistant to inflammation. 
      A Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 
      knockout of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) gene in polydactyly chondrocytes 
      provides multivalent protection against the signals that activate the 
      pro-inflammatory and catabolic NF-κB pathway. The TAK1-KO chondrocytes 
      encapsulated into a hyaluronan hydrogel deposit copious cartilage extracellular 
      matrix proteins and facilitate integration onto native cartilage, even under 
      proinflammatory conditions. Furthermore, when implanted in vivo, compared to WT 
      fewer pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages invaded the cartilage, likely due to the 
      lower levels of cytokines secreted by the TAK1-KO polydactyly chondrocytes. Our 
      engineered cartilage thus represents a new paradigm-shift for creation of more 
      potent and functional tissues for use in regenerative medicine. This article is

TI  - Effects of ultrasound-guided platelet-rich plasma combined with sodium 
      hyaluronate on shoulder function recovery, pain degree and mental health of 
      patients with rotator cuff injury.
PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1080/02648725.2023.2183312 [doi]
AB  - Rotator cuff injury is a common condition that affects the shoulder and is 
      characterized by damage to the tendons and muscles in the shoulder area. This 
      type of injury can lead to decreased shoulder function, pain, and decreased 
      quality of life for those affected. As such, finding effective treatments for 
      rotator cuff injury is important for improving patient outcomes and reducing the 
      impact of this condition on patients and society. The purpose of this study was 
      to evaluate the effectiveness of SH (Sodium Hyaluronate) and PRP (Platelet-Rich 
      Plasma) in treating rotator cuff injuries in the shoulder. Patients who were 
      diagnosed with Rotator Cuff Injury (RCI) and received treatment at the hospital 
      were selected as the study subjects and divided into four groups. Various 
      treatments were given to patients in each group. Two-way ANOVA and Mann-Whitney 
      tests were used to analyze the results. The study found that patients who 
      received ultrasound-guided platelet-rich plasma combined with sodium hyaluronate 
      had significantly higher shoulder function recovery rates and better quality of 
      life compared to the other groups. They also reported significantly lower pain 
      scores compared to the other groups. The results suggest that ultrasound-guided 
      platelet-rich plasma combined with sodium hyaluronate can effectively improve the 
      shoulder function of patients with rotator cuff injury, reducing pain and 
      improving their overall well-being. This has implications for improving patient 
      outcomes and reducing the impact of rotator cuff injury on patients and society 
      by providing a promising treatment option for this common condition.

TI  - A 37-Year-Old Man with Familial Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and 
      Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations Presenting with Seizures and a Diagnosis of 
      Brain Abscesses.
PG  - e938548
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.938548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal 
      dominant genetic disease associated with arteriovenous malformations involving 
      diverse organs. Neurological complications from brain abscesses (BA) secondary to 
      pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) is a serious and recognized, albeit 
      infrequent, medical problem. We report the case of a 37-year-old man with 
      familial HHT and PAVMs who presented with seizures as a manifestation of BA. CASE 
      REPORT A 37-year-old man was admitted for first tonic-clonic seizures. He had a 
      history of recurrent epistaxis and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeds treated with 
      fulguration and oral iron therapy. A diagnosis of HHT was made because the 
      patient met 3 of 4 Curaçao criteria. Physical examination revealed hypoxemia 
      without dyspnea. A chest X-ray detected nodular pulmonary lesions in both lower 
      lobes. Cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed 3 space-occupying lesions. 
      Antiepileptics and dexamethasone were started. Cranial magnetic resonance and 
      positron emission tomography suggested that lesions were BA. Thoracoabdominal CT 
      with contrast revealed several bilateral PAVMs. Blood cultures were repeatedly 
      negative. With the presumptive diagnosis of septic-embolic BA, empirical 
      antibiotic therapy was started for 8 weeks. Neurological symptoms resolved and 
      malformations >2 cm were selectively embolized. A genetic study revealed exon5 
      mutations in the ENG gene. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the association 
      between PAVMs in a patient with HHT and development of BA. Clinicians should be 
      aware of this association so that diagnosis and treatment can be provided as fast 
      as possible to ensure the best outcome for the patient. Embolization was 
      performed as preventive treatment, and a genetic study was conducted as it is 
      potentially useful for primary prevention in the patient's offspring.

TI  - Bioinformatics-based diagnosis and evaluation of several pivotal genes and 
      pathways associated with immune infiltration at different time points in spinal 
      cord injury.
PG  - 1-27
LID - 10.1080/02648725.2023.2178970 [doi]
AB  - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological event. To assess the 
      degree of spinal cord damage and classify the injury, it is recommended to use 
      the 2019 version of the AIS standard. The severity of trauma was evaluated using 
      the Trauma Severity Score, and various classification systems have been proposed 
      for injuries at different parts and segments of the spine. Understanding the 
      regulated signaling pathways and immune processes following SCI can lead to a 
      better understanding of SCI-induced biomarkers and their underlying mechanisms. 
      In this study, two gene expression datasets (GSE464 and GSE45006) from the Gene 
      Expression Omnibus database were utilized. Differential gene expression and 
      co-expression network analysis were performed, revealing 370 shared genes in the 
      3-day group and 111 shared genes in the 14-day group after SCI. The study used 
      functional enrichment analysis methods such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene 
      Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The ssGSEA method was used 
      to assess the levels and composition of immune infiltration in both the sham 
      (control) and SCI groups. The single-cell transcriptomics dataset GSE182803 was 
      analyzed to identify genes associated with immune marker cells. Four key genes 
      (Ptgs2, Fn1, Ccl2, and Icam1) were identified in the 3-day group, while only one 
      gene (Cyp51) was identified in the 14-day group after SCI. The findings offer 
      significant insights into the immune-related genes and signaling pathways 
      involved in secondary SCI at different time points and hold potential for the 
      development of intervention strategies for acute and chronic post-SCI.

TI  - Transcatheter closure of large postinfarct ventricular septal defect: Initial 
      results of prototype Occlutech® device including the first-in-human.
PG  - 620-627
LID - 10.1002/ccd.30571 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postinfarct ventricular septal rupture is a serious complication in 
      delayed or failed reperfusion with a grim prognosis. The optimal timing and 
      treatment option remain debatable in the absence of randomized controlled trials. 
      Percutaneous device closure is a well-reported and less invasive treatment option 
      but recent imaging studies indicate that majority of defects are too large to be 
      adequately covered by the currently Conformite Europeenne and Food and Drug 
      Administration approved occluder devices. METHODS: Six patients presented with 
      large and complex postinfarct ventricular septal ruptures, considered unsuitable 
      for the Amplatzer post-infarct ventricular septal defect Occluder, so were 
      treated using the prototype Occlutech® 36 mm PI-VSD occluder, including the 
      first-in-human use. RESULTS: The prototype device was successfully deployed in 
      all patients with satisfactory immediate results and shunt reduction. Three 
      patients (50%) in cardiogenic shock did not survive beyond discharge, of which 
      two were complicated by device dislodgement or embolization. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Percutaneous closure of large postinfarct ventricular septal ruptures is possible 
      using newer device with a wider coverage. Further device refinement is necessary 
      to improve treatment outcomes.

TI  - TRIM29 promotes podocyte pyroptosis in diabetic nephropathy through the 
      NF-kB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.
LID - 10.1002/cbin.12006 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common complications of diabetes. 
      Gradual loss of podocytes is a sign of DN and pyroptosis mechanistically 
      correlates with podocyte injury in DN; however, the mechanism(s) involved remain 
      unknown. Here we reveal that TRIM29 is overexpressed in high glucose (HG)-treated 
      murine podocytes cells and that TRIM29 silencing significantly inhibits podocyte 
      damage due to HG treatment, as evidenced by lower desmin expression and greater 
      nephrin expression. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis showed that TRIM29 
      silencing significantly inhibited HG treatment-induced pyroptosis, which was 
      confirmed by immunoblotting for NLRP3, active Caspase-1, GSDMD-N, and 
      phosphorylated NF-κB-p65. Conversely, overexpression of TRIM29 could trigger 
      pyroptosis that was attenuated by NF-κB inhibition, indicating that TRIM29 
      promotes pyroptosis through the NF-κB pathway. Mechanistic studies revealed that 
      TRIM29 interacts with IκBα to mediate its ubiquitination-dependent degradation, 
      which in turn leads to NF-κB activation. Taken together, our data demonstrate 
      that TRIM29 can promote podocyte pyroptosis by activating the NF-κB/NLRP3 
      pathway. Thus, TRIM29 represents a potentially novel therapeutic target that may 
      also be clinically relevant in the management of DN.

TI  - Study on college students' willingness to inoculate COVID-19 vaccine based on 
      bioinformatics and KAP analysis.

LID - 10.1080/02648725.2023.2183314 [doi]
AB  - Bioinformatics is a subject that analyzes and interprets the collection, 
      processing, storage and dissemination of biological information, and explores 
      biological problems by using information technology and related means. The 
      outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia has been nearly three years. With the 
      advancement of vaccine research and development in various countries, mass 
      vaccination is bound to usher in a new turning point for epidemic control. 
      China's policy of free vaccination for the new coronavirus vaccine will 
      undoubtedly improve the vaccination rate, however, the vaccination rate still 
      depends on people's will. This paper takes college students as the main research 
      object. In the context of bioinformatics analysis, a questionnaire survey was 
      conducted based on their knowledge, attitudes, and practice levels of COVID-19 
      vaccines. The results vividly illustrate five conclusions. Firstly, the 
      reliability of information sources positively affected college students' 
      cognitive level, degree of trust and inoculation intention of COVID-19 
      vaccination. Secondly, the professional degree of media positively affected 
      college students' degree of trust and inoculation intention behavior of COVID-19 
      vaccine. Thirdly, the cognitive level and degree of trust about COVID-19 vaccine 
      positively affected college students' intention behavior of COVID-19 vaccine 
      vaccination. Fourthly, the positivity of information positively affected the 
      willingness of college students to vaccinate against COVID-19 vaccine. Fifthly, 
      there were significant differences in the willingness and behavior of college 
      students with different genders in COVID-19 vaccination. Finally, three 
      suggestions are given to improve college students' willingness to vaccinate 
      against the coronavirus and to cope with similar incidents in the future.

AB  - Silicon is attractive for lithium-ion batteries and beyond but suffers large 
      volume change upon cycling. Hierarchical tactics show promise yet lack control 
      over the unit construction and arrangement, limiting stability improvement at the 
      practical level. Here, a protocol is developed as controlled isotropic 
      canalization of micro-sized silicon. Distinct from the existing strategies, it 
      involves isotropic canalization by honeycomb-like radial arrangement of silicon 
      nanosheets, and canal consolidation by controlled dual bonding of silicon with 
      carbon. The proof-of-concept nitrogen-doped carbon dual-bonded silicon 
      honeycomb-like microparticles, specifically with a medium density of C-N-Si and 
      C-O-Si bonds, exhibit stable cycling impressively at high rates and 
      industrial-scale loadings. Two key issues involve isotropic canalization 
      facilitating ion transport in all directions of individual granules and 
      controlled consolidation conferring selective ion permeation and securing charge 
      transport. The study highlights the configurational isotropy and interfacial 
      bonding density, provides insight into rational design and manufacture of silicon 
      and others with industry-viable features. This article is protected by copyright.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate the use of cutting 
      balloon (CB) inflated at high pressure compared with noncompliant balloon (NCB) 
      for the treatment of calcified coronary lesions. BACKGROUND: No data are 
      available regarding the safety and efficacy of CB inflated at high pressure in 
      coronary artery calcifications. METHODS: Patients with calcified lesions (more 
      than 100° of calcium demonstrated at baseline intravascular ultrasound) were 
      randomized. Primary endpoint of the study was the final minimal stent area (MSA) 
      and stent symmetry in the calcific segment. Secondary endpoints included rate of 
      device failure and the 1-year rate of target lesion revascularization, target 
      vessel revascularization, and major adverse cardiovascular events. RESULTS: From 
      September 2019 to June 2021, a total of 100 patients were included and 
      randomized; 13 patients were excluded for major protocol deviations. Lesions were 
      complex (type B2/C n = 61 [71.2%]) with a mean arch of calcium of 266 ± 84°, a 
      calcium length of 12 ± 6.6 mm. CB was inflated at comparable atmospheres when 
      compared with NCB (18.3 ± 5 vs. 19 ± 4.5, p = 0.46). In the per-protocol 
      population, the final MSA at the level of the calcium site was significantly 
      higher in the CB group (8.1 ± 2 vs. 7.3 ± 2.1, p = 0.035) with a higher 
      eccentricity index achieved in the CB group (0.84 ± 0.07 vs. 0.8 ± 0.08, 
      p = 0.013). Three device failure occurred in the CB group. One-year follow-up 
      outcomes were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of calcified lesions with 
      high-pressure CB has a good safety profile and is associated with a larger MSA 
      and higher eccentricity of the stent at the level of the calcium site compared 
      with NCB.

TI  - Serial quantitative angiographic study of target lumen enlargement after 
      drug-coated balloon angioplasty for native coronary artery disease.
LID - 10.1002/ccd.30598 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Target lumen enlargement (TLE) or "late lumen enlargement" is often 
      encountered after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-coated 
      balloons (DCB). To date, the prognosis of coronary arterial lesions with or 
      without TLE has not been clearly elucidated. AIMS: This study aimed to assess the 
      long-term prognosis of coronary arterial lesions with or without TLE observed 
      within 1 year (early TLE) after DCB angioplasty using serial quantitative 
      angiographic follow-up. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-three consecutive 
      patients (de novo coronary arterial lesions, 251) who underwent follow-up 
      angiography within 1 year after DCB angioplasty (early follow-up, median: 6 
      months) were retrospectively evaluated. Of these, 97 patients (125 lesions) also 
      underwent angiography more than 1 year after DCB angioplasty (late follow-up, 
      median: 37 months). TLE was defined as an increase in minimal lumen diameter 
      (MLD) after PCI at each follow-up. RESULTS: Early TLE was detected in 142 lesions 
      (56.6%). Of these, 76 lesions were also evaluated at late follow-up. TLE 
      persisted even at late follow-up in 67 of the 76 lesions (88.2%). An increase in 
      MLD in early TLE (+) lesions was observed in the period between post-PCI and 
      early follow-up (1.84 ± 0.06 vs. 2.12 ± 0.07 mm, p < 0.001) but not between early 
      and late follow-up (2.12 ± 0.07 vs. 2.16 ± 0.07 mm, p = 0.74). In contrast, 49 of 
      109 lesions without early TLE were evaluated at late follow-up, of which 28 
      lesions (57.1%) showed TLE at late follow-up. The MLD of early TLE (-) lesions 
      (n = 49) significantly increased from early (1.63 ± 0.061 mm) to late follow-up 
      (1.84 ± 0.06 mm) (p < 0.001). No aneurysms were found in any of these cases. 
      CONCLUSION: Early TLE was observed in more than half of the lesions, with the 
      majority remaining at late follow-up. Alternatively, half of the lesions without 
      early TLE showed late TLE, occurring biphasically after DCB angioplasty.

TI  - A new echocardiographic index to select patients for PFO suture-mediated 
      percutaneous closure.
LID - 10.1002/ccd.30604 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify a simple echocardiographic predictor of procedural 
      success to select patient for percutaneous suture-mediated patent fossa ovalis 
      (PFO) closure. BACKGROUND: Percutaneous suture-mediated PFO closure has been 
      shown as a safe and advantageous alternative to device-based PFO closure, yet its 
      overall success is slightly lower in unselected patients. METHODS: Preprocedural 
      transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) of 302 patients (113 men, 45 ± 12 years) who 
      underwent percutaneous suture-mediated PFO closure were reviewed. RESULTS: At 
      echocardiographic follow-up (3-6 months), residual right-to-left shunt (RLS) ≥2 
      was found in 60 (19.9%) patients. At multivariable analysis, only two anatomical 
      variables measured at preprocedural TEE were found as independent predictors of 
      residual RLS ≥ 2 at follow-up: PFO maximum width (odds ratio [OR] 1.89, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 1.16-3.40, p = 0.02) and PFO minimal septa overlapping 
      (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.88, p = 0.02). An index based on the ratio of PFO maximum 
      width to PFO minimum septal overlapping (W/SO) proved to be the most powerful 
      predictor of RLS ≥ 2 at follow-up (OR 48.1, 95% CI 9.3-352.2, p < 0.01). The ROC 
      curve for the W/SO ratio was found to have an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.93) and 
      a cut-off value of 0.61 yielding a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 78% with 
      a negative predictive value of 94%. A decision tree methodology's AUC was 0.75 
      (95% CI 0.67-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the 
      ratio between the maximum amplitude of the PFO and the minimum overlap of the 
      septa is the best predictive index of a favorable result by using one stitch 
      only.

TI  - Narrow beam breast CT: proof-of-concept.
LID - 10.1002/mp.16332 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In breast CT, scattered photons form a large portion of the acquired 
      signal, adversely impacting image quality throughout the frequency response of 
      the imaging system. Prior studies provided evidence for a new image acquisition 
      design, dubbed Narrow Beam Breast CT (NB-bCT), in preventing scatter acquisition. 
      PURPOSE: Here, we report the design, implementation, and initial characterization 
      of the first NB-bCT prototype. METHODS: The imaging system's apparatus is 
      composed of two primary assemblies: a dynamic Fluence Modulator (collimator) and 
      a photon-counting line detector. The design of the assemblies enables them to 
      operate in lockstep during image acquisition, converting sourced x-rays into a 
      moving narrow beam. During a projection, this narrow beam sweeps the entire fan 
      angle coverage of the imaging system. The assemblies are each comprised of a 
      metal housing, a sensory system, and a robotic system. A controller unit handles 
      their relative movements. To study the impact of fluence modulation on the signal 
      received in the detector, three physical breast phantoms, representative of 
      small, average, and large size breasts, were developed and imaged, and acquired 
      projections analyzed. The scatter acquisition in each projection as a function of 
      breast phantom size was investigated. The imaging system's spatial resolution at 
      the center and periphery of the field of view was measured. RESULTS: Minimal 
      acquisition of scattered rays occurs during image acquisition with NB-bCT; 
      results in minimal scatter to primary ratios in small, average, and large breast 
      phantoms imaged were 0.05, 0.07, and 0.9, respectively. System spatial resolution 
      of 5.2 lp/mm at 10% max MTF and 2.9 lp/mm at 50% max MTF at the center of the 
      field of view was achieved, with minimal loss with the shift toward the corner 
      (5.0 lp/mm at 10% max MTF and 2.5 lp/mm at 50% max MTF). CONCLUSION: The 
      disclosed development, implementation, and characterization of a physical NB-bCT 
      prototype system demonstrates a new method of CT-based image acquisition that 
      yields high spatial resolution while minimizing scatter-components in acquired 
      projections. This methodology holds promise for high-resolution CT-imaging 
      applications in which reduction of scatter contamination is desirable.

TI  - CT-based radiomics for the identification of colorectal cancer liver metastases 
      sensitive to first-line irinotecan-based chemotherapy.
LID - 10.1002/mp.16325 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemosensitivity prediction in colorectal cancer patients with liver 
      metastases has remained a research hotspot. Radiomics can extract features from 
      patient imaging, and deep learning or machine learning can be used to build 
      models to predict patient outcomes prior to chemotherapy. PURPOSE: In this study, 
      the radiomics features and clinical data of colorectal cancer patients with liver 
      metastases were used to predict their sensitivity to irinotecan-based 
      chemotherapy. METHODS: A total of 116 patients with unresectable colorectal 
      cancer liver metastases who received first-line irinotecan-based chemotherapy 
      from January 2015 to January 2020 in our institution were retrospectively 
      collected. Overall, 116 liver metastases were randomly divided into training (n = 
      81) and validation (n = 35) cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. The effect of chemotherapy 
      was determined based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The lesions 
      were divided into response and nonresponse groups. Regions of interest (ROIs) 
      were manually segmented, and sample sizes of 1×1×1, 3×3×3, 5×5×5 mm(3) were used 
      to extract radiomics features. The relevant features were identified through 
      Pearson correlation analysis and the MRMR algorithm, and the clinical data were 
      merged into the artificial neural network. Finally, the p-model was obtained 
      after repeated learning and testing. RESULTS: The p-model could distinguish 
      responders in the training (area under the curve [AUC] 0.754, 95% CI 0.650-0.858) 
      and validation cohorts (AUC 0.752 95% CI 0.581-0.904). AUC values of the pure 
      image group model are 0.720 (95% CI 0.609-0.827) and 0.684 (95% CI 0.529-0.890) 
      for the training and validation cohorts respectively. As for the clinical data 
      model, AUC values of the training and validation cohorts are 0.638 (95% CI 
      0.500-0.757) and 0.545 (95% CI 0.360-0.785), respectively. The performances of 
      the latter two are less than that of the former. CONCLUSION: The p-model has the 
      potential to discriminate colorectal cancer patients sensitive to chemotherapy. 
      This model holds promise as a noninvasive tool to predict the response of 
      colorectal liver metastases to chemotherapy, allowing for personalized treatment 
      planning.

TI  - Agitation does not induce fibrillation in reduced Hen Egg-White Lysozyme at 
      physiological temperature and pH.

AB  - Several proteins and peptides tend to form an amyloid fibril, causing a range of 
      unrelated diseases, from neurodegenerative to certain types of cancer. In the 
      native state, these proteins are folded and soluble. However, these proteins 
      acquired β-sheet amyloid fibril due to unfolding and aggregation. The conversion 
      mechanism from well-folded soluble into amorphous or amyloid fibril is not well 
      understood yet. Here, we induced unfolding and aggregation of Hen egg-white 
      lysozyme (HEWL) by reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) and applied mechanical 
      sheering force by constant shaking (1000 rpm) on the thermostat for seven days. 
      Our turbidity results showed that reduced HEWL rapidly formed aggregates, and a 
      plateau was attained in nearly 5 hours of incubation in both shaking and 
      non-shaking conditions. The turbidity was lower in the shaking condition than in 
      the non-shaking condition. The ThT binding and TEM micrographs showed that 
      reduced HEWL formed amorphous aggregates in both conditions. Far-UV CD results 
      showed that reduced HEWL lost nearly all alpha-helical structure, and β-sheet 
      secondary structure was not formed in both conditions. All the spectroscopic and 
      microscopic results showed that reduced HEWL formed amorphous aggregates under 
      both conditions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Heart failure treatment in patients with and without obesity with an ejection 
      fraction below 50.
PG  - e13976
LID - 10.1111/eci.13976 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess heart failure (HF) treatment in 
      patients with and without obesity in a large contemporary real-world Western 
      European cohort. METHODS: Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction 
      (LVEF) <50% and available information on body mass index (BMI) were selected from 
      the CHECK-HF registry. The CHECK-HF registry included chronic HF patients in the 
      period between 2013 and 2016 in 34 Dutch outpatient clinics. Patients were 
      divided into BMI categories. Differences in HF medical treatment were analysed, 
      and multivariable logistic regression analysis (dichotomized as BMI <30 kg/m(2) 
      and ≥30 kg/m(2) ) was performed. RESULTS: Seven thousand six hundred seventy-one 
      patients were included, 1284 (16.7%) had a BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) , and 618 (8.1%) had a 
      BMI ≥35 kg/m(2) . Median BMI was 26.4 kg/m(2) . Patients with obesity were 
      younger and had a higher rate of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, 
      hypertension and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSAS). Prescription rates of 
      guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) increased significantly with BMI. The 
      differences were most pronounced for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists 
      (MRAs) and diuretics. Patients with obesity more often received the 
      guideline-recommended target dose. In multivariable logistic regression, obesity 
      was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of receiving ≥100% of the 
      guideline-recommended target dose of beta-blockers (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10-1.62), 
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-inhibitors (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15-1.57) and MRAs 
      (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04-1.87). CONCLUSIONS: Guideline-recommended HF drugs are more 
      frequently prescribed and at a higher dose in patients with obesity as compared 
      to HF patients without obesity.

TI  - Real-World Hepatic Safety of Oral Acetaminophen versus Loxoprofen/Celecoxib: 
      Using a Nationwide Electronic Medical Record Database.
LID - 10.1002/jcph.2216 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of liver injury associated 
      with acetaminophen compared with commonly prescribed two non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs, loxoprofen and celecoxib, over one-year period. This 
      study used an electronic medical record database obtained from 219 medical 
      institutions in Japan. Eligible patients were individuals with initial 
      prescription of oral acetaminophen, loxoprofen, or celecoxib prescribed for ≥28 
      days of treatment between January 2015 and December 2019. Primary outcome was the 
      incidence rate of liver injury, defined as the diagnosis of liver disease and 
      elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (>3 times the upper limit of 
      normal). Primary hypothesis was that acetaminophen would be non-inferior to 
      loxoprofen or celecoxib with regards to the incidence of liver injury, with a 
      noninferiority margin of 1.39. In result, a total of 83,976 patients were 
      eligible in this study. The numbers of events per 100 person-years for the 
      primary outcome were 0.64, 0.52, and 0.41 in acetaminophen, loxoprofen, and 
      celecoxib, respectively; the differences did not meet the non-inferiority margin. 
      Two secondary outcomes of the incidence rates (events per 100 person-years) of 
      the diagnosis of liver disease were 1.51, 1.38, and 1.11, and those of elevated 
      ALT were 9.69, 7.75, and 7.90 in acetaminophen, loxoprofen, and celecoxib, 
      respectively; three of four comparison group differences did meet the 
      non-inferiority margin. In conclusion, the non-inferiority of acetaminophen to 
      loxoprofen and celecoxib in terms of the risk of liver injury in clinical 
      practice was inconclusive in this study. This article is protected by copyright.

PG  - e2212078
LID - 10.1002/adma.202212078 [doi]
AB  - New types of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices based on redox 
      electrocatalytic reactions possess great potential in renewable energy to 
      maximize energy utilization and balance environmental issues. The typical device 
      is the metal-redox bicatalyst battery, where the cathode is redox bifunctional 
      catalyst (named as redox bicatalyst) with gas, solid, liquid as active reactants 
      while anode is metal, driven by cathodic electrocatalytic reactions during 
      charge/discharge processes, which promotes the energy storage and chemical 
      production. In this system, the metal anode, redox-bicatalyst cathode, 
      electrolytes and the redox electrochemical reactions can be modified and adjusted 
      to achieve the optimal energy conversion and utilization. Therefore, the deep 
      understanding of the electrochemical system is conducive to designing new devices 
      to meet the demand among various applications, including energy storage and 
      conversion. In this review, we clarify the fundamentals and design principles of 
      the rechargeable/reversible metal-redox bicatalyst batteries and how each part 
      affects the devices in energy conversion and chemical production. We summarize 
      the electrocatalytic reduction/oxidation reactions, the reported systems relied 
      on redox reactions and the corresponding redox bicatalysts. Finally, a 
      perspective of the key challenges and the possible new types of metal-redox 
      bicatalyst batteries for efficient energy utilization and chemical production are 
      given. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Is Clozapine-induced Weight Gain Dose-dependent? Results From a Prospective 
      Cohort Study.
LID - sbad009 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbad009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic-induced metabolic adverse effects are risk factors for 
      cardiometabolic comorbidities. Whether dose lowering could mitigate such effects 
      remains unclear. The present study aims to investigate the associations between 
      clozapine doses and modifications of weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, and 
      lipid levels. STUDY DESIGN: Linear mixed-effects models of weight changes over 1 
      year and of variations of other metabolic parameters over 4 months were applied 
      to a prospective cohort of 115 patients. Age- and sex-stratified analyses of 
      weight changes were also performed. STUDY RESULTS: Each 100 mg dose increment of 
      clozapine was associated on average with a +0.48% weight increase (P = .004) over 
      1 year of treatment. Weight increase was greater for treatment duration ≤3 vs >3 
      months (+0.84% and +0.47% per month, respectively, P < .001), with a significant 
      association with the dose for durations >3 months (+0.54%, P = .004) and a trend 
      for durations ≤3 months (+0.33%, P = .075). Dose increments of 100 mg were also 
      associated with weight increases of +0.71% among adults (P = .001), +1.91% among 
      the elderly (P < .001) and +1.32% among men (P < .001) with no associations among 
      women (P = .62). Among young adults, weight change was positively associated with 
      doses ≤300 mg/day (+2.19% per 100 mg, P = .001), whereas no association was found 
      with doses >300 mg/day (P = .60). No significant effect of clozapine dose on 
      other metabolic parameters was found. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a modest 
      effect of clozapine dose increases on weight gain over 1 year with differences 
      among age categories and sexes and no dose effect on other metabolic parameters 
      over 4 months.

TI  - Laser-Carbonization - A powerful tool for micro-fabrication of patterned 
      electronic carbons.
PG  - e2211054
LID - 10.1002/adma.202211054 [doi]
AB  - Fabricating electronic devices from natural, renewable resources has been a 
      common goal in engineering and materials science for many years. In this regard, 
      carbon is of special significance due to its biocompatibility combined with 
      electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability. In microelectronics, 
      however, carbon's device application is often inhibited by tedious and expensive 
      preparation processes and lack of control over processing and material 
      parameters. Laser-assisted carbonization is emerging as a tool for precise and 
      selective synthesis of functional carbon-based materials for flexible device 
      applications. In contrast to conventional carbonization via in-furnace pyrolysis, 
      laser-carbonization is induced photo-thermally and occurs on the time-scale of 
      milliseconds. By careful selection of the precursors and process parameters, the 
      properties of this so-called laser-patterned carbon (LP-C) such as porosity, 
      surface polarity, functional groups, degree of graphitization, charge-carrier 
      structure etc. can be tuned. In this critical review, we generate a common 
      perspective on laser-carbonization in the context of general carbonization 
      strategies, fundamentals of laser-induced materials processing, and flexible 
      electronic applications, like electrodes for sensors, electrocatalysts, energy 
      storage, or antennas. An attempt is made to have equal emphasis on material 
      processing and applications aspects such that this emerging technology can be 
      optimally positioned in the broader context of carbon-based microfabrication.

TI  - Visuospatial Learning Selectively Enhanced by Personalized Transcranial Magnetic 
      Stimulation over Parieto-Hippocampal Network among Patients at Clinical High-Risk 
      for Psychosis.
LID - sbad015 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbad015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Cognitive deficits in visuospatial learning (VSL) are 
      highly associated with an increased risk of developing psychosis among 
      populations with clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Early interventions 
      targeting VSL enhancement are warranted in CHR but remain rudimentary. We 
      investigated whether personalized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over 
      the left parieto-hippocampal network could improve VSL performance in CHR 
      patients and if it could reduce the risk of psychosis conversion within 1 year. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-five CHR patients were randomized to receive active or sham 
      TMS treatments using an accelerated TMS protocol, consisting of 10 sessions of 20 
      Hz TMS treatments within 2 days. TMS target was defined by individual 
      parieto-hippocampal functional connectivity and precisely localized by individual 
      structural magnetic resonance imaging. VSL performance was measured using Brief 
      Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised included in measurement and treatment research 
      to improve cognition in schizophrenia consensus cognitive battery (MCCB). 
      Fifty-eight CHR patients completed the TMS treatments and MCCB assessments and 
      were included in the data analysis. STUDY RESULTS: We observed significant VSL 
      improvements in the active TMS subgroup (Cohen's d = 0.71, P < .001) but not in 
      the sham TMS subgroup (Cohen's d = 0.07, P = .70). In addition, active TMS 
      improved the precision of VSL performance. At a 1-year follow-up, CHR patients 
      who received active TMS showed a lower psychosis conversion rate than those who 
      received sham TMS (6.7% vs 28.0%, χ2 = 4.45, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      demonstrate that personalized TMS in the left parieto-hippocampal network may be 
      a promising preventive intervention that improves VSL in CHR patients and reduces 
      the risk of psychosis conversion at follow-up.

TI  - Influence of ALS-linked M337V mutation on the conformational ensembles of 
      TDP-43(321-340) peptide monomer and dimer.
LID - 10.1002/prot.26482 [doi]
AB  - The transactive response (TAR) DNA/RNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) can 
      self-assemble into both functional stress granules via liquid-liquid phase 
      separation (LLPS) and pathogenic amyloid fibrillary aggregates that are closely 
      linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Previous experimental studies reported 
      that the low complexity domain (LCD) of TDP-43 plays an essential role in the 
      LLPS and aggregation of the full-length protein, and it alone can also undergo 
      LLPS to form liquid droplets mainly via intermolecular interactions in the 
      321-340 region. And the ALS-associated M337V mutation impairs LCD's LLPS and 
      facilitates liquid-solid phase transition. However, the underlying atomistic 
      mechanism is not well understood. Herein, as a first step to understand the 
      M337V-caused LLPS disruption of TDP-43 LCD mediated by the 321-340 region and the 
      fibrillization enhancement, we investigated the conformational properties of 
      monomer/dimer of TDP-43(321-340) peptide and its M337V mutant by performing 
      extensive all-atom explicit-solvent replica exchange molecular dynamic 
      simulations. Our simulations demonstrate that M337V mutation alters the residue 
      regions with high helix/β-structure propensities and thus affects the 
      conformational ensembles of both monomer and dimer. M337V mutation inhibits helix 
      formation in the N-terminal Ala-rich region and the C-terminal mutation site 
      region, while facilitating their long β-sheet formation, albeit with a minor 
      impact on the average probability of both helix structure and β-structure. 
      Further analysis of dimer system shows that M337V mutation disrupts 
      inter-molecular helix-helix interactions and W334-W334 π-π stacking interactions 
      which were reported to be important for the LLPS of TDP-43 LCD, whereas enhances 
      the overall peptide residue-residue interactions and weakens peptide-water 
      interactions, which is conducive to peptide fibrillization. This study provides 
      mechanistic insights into the M337V-mutation-induced impairment of phase 
      separation and facilitation of fibril formation of TDP-43 LCD.

TI  - Impact of early memories and current experiences of warmth and safeness on 
      adolescents' psychological distress.
LID - 10.1111/jora.12843 [doi]
AB  - A variable-centered and a person-centered approach were performed to examine the 
      role of early memories of warmth and safeness (EMWS) and current experiences of 
      warmth and safeness (CEWS) on depressive and anxious symptoms among adolescents 
      from community and residential youth care (RYC) settings. Variable-centered 
      results revealed EMWS were only indirectly (through CEWS) associated with 
      depressive and anxious symptoms. Person-centered outcomes allowed to identify 
      four different profiles based on EMWS and CEWS, which differed on depressive and 
      anxious symptoms. EMWS and CEWS seem to play an important role in psychological 
      distress during adolescence. CEWS seem to have a protective role on RYC 
      adolescents' psychological distress, even when EMWS were poor.

TI  - Communication, information, involvement and decision making: A systematic scoping 
      review of child-parent-nurse relationships during postoperative pain management.
LID - 10.1111/jocn.16655 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To examine the existing literature on child-parent-nurse relationships (in 
      relation to communication, information, and involvement and decision-making) 
      during postoperative pain management. BACKGROUND: Pain in children is 
      under-reported and under-treated in hospitals and research has continued to 
      report high rates of pain among hospitalised children worldwide. The role of 
      child-parent-nurse relationships may be a factor and to date, no review has been 
      identified that focus on these relationships during postoperative pain 
      management. DESIGN: A systematic scoping review following Arksey and O'Malley 
      with further adaptations based on JBI. METHODS: A systematic search for published 
      primary studies was conducted using the Medline, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, 
      ASSIA, PsycINFO, Science Direct and Web of Science in English from 2000 to 2022. 
      Two reviewers independently carried out data screening and extraction and any 
      differences were resolved with the assistance of a third reviewer. The data were 
      analysed using thematic analysis and presented descriptively. This study followed 
      the PRISMA-ScR Checklist. RESULTS: A total of 37 studies met the inclusion 
      criteria. The findings mainly demonstrated a focus on the perspectives of parents 
      and nurses with less on children's perspectives and none of the studies explored 
      child-nurse relationships. The findings were categorised under three themes: 
      communication, information, and involvement and decision making. CONCLUSION: A 
      prevailing deficiency in child-parent-nurse relationships significantly 
      contributed to suboptimal postoperative pain care, causing prolonged and 
      untreated postoperative pain in children. Children's hesitation in communicating 
      with nurses, the limited communication skills of nurses, and the weak 
      communication position of parents in a hospital setting all hindered the 
      development of strong relationships between children, parents, and nurses. The 
      unclear definition of the roles of children and parents in postoperative pain 
      management resulted in confusion for both parents and nurses. This was 
      exacerbated by parents' lack of knowledge and inadequate guidance from nurses, 
      ultimately leading to a decreased level of parental involvement in their child's 
      postoperative pain management while in the hospital. Unattended requests for pain 
      management caused children to experience prolonged pain and led to a 
      deterioration in the relationship between parents and nurses, as well as a 
      reduction in the parents' ability to provide pain care to their child. RELEVANCE 
      TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlights the reasons behind the suboptimal 
      management of postoperative pain in children. The importance of the relationship 
      between children, parents, and nurses in pain management must be acknowledged, 
      and the results of this study may be used to inform improvements in nursing pain 
      management practices. NO PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Patient or public 
      contribution is not a necessary stage in a systematic scoping review following 
      Arksey and O'Malley's framework.

TI  - Attitudes and self-efficacy towards infection prevention and control and 
      antibiotic stewardship among nurses: A mixed-methods study.
LID - 10.1111/jocn.16657 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To gain a comprehensive understanding of nurses' infection control 
      practices, antibiotics stewardship attitudes and self-efficacy when caring for 
      patients with multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in a hospital setting. 
      BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant bacteria cause a substantial health burden by 
      complicating infections and prolonging hospital stays. Attitudes and 
      self-efficacy can inform professional behaviour. Nurses' attitudes and 
      self-efficacy concerning multidrug-resistant bacteria, infection prevention and 
      control and antibiotic stewardship are vital in keeping patients safe. DESIGN: A 
      descriptive and convergent mixed-methods design involving quantitative and 
      qualitative approaches was used. METHODS: Two hundred and seventeen nurses 
      working in clinical practice at seven different hospital wards (i.e., general 
      medicine, surgical, haematological and oncology) at a Norwegian university 
      hospital were invited to participate. Data were collected in February and March 
      2020 via two questionnaires: the Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria Attitude 
      Questionnaire and the General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale (n = 131) and four 
      focus group interviews (n = 22). The data were analysed using descriptive 
      statistics and systematic text condensation. RESULTS: Most nurses showed moderate 
      knowledge, adequate behavioural intentions towards infection prevention and 
      antibiotic stewardship, and high self-efficacy. However, they reported negative 
      emotions towards their knowledge level and negative emotions towards nursing 
      care. The nurses appeared uncertain about their professional influence and role 
      in antibiotic stewardship practices. Organisational and relational challenges and 
      ambivalent perceptions of nurses' role were potential explanations. CONCLUSION: 
      Nurses report moderate attitudes and high self-efficacy when caring for patients 
      with multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. This study suggests that nurses 
      experience organisational and relational factors in their work environment that 
      challenge their attitudes towards infection prevention and control and antibiotic 
      stewardship practices. Measures that strengthen their knowledge and emotional 
      response underpin correct infection prevention and control behaviour. A role 
      clarification is needed for antibiotic stewardship. No Patient or Public 
      Contribution. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Measures to increase attitudes 
      towards infection prevention and control, antibiotic stewardship and multidrug 
      resistance is recommended. Measures should be taken to overcome organisational 
      challenges. A clarification of the nurses' role in antibiotic stewardship is 
      needed.

TI  - Stigma toward internalizing and externalizing disorders: How do adolescents 
      perceive their peers? A network analysis approach.
LID - 10.1111/jora.12839 [doi]
AB  - This study's first aim was to explore whether stigma's facets differ between 
      internalizing and externalizing disorders in adolescence. The second aim was to 
      compare the relationships among stigma's facets toward these disorders. Two 
      vignettes depicting a peer with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or 
      Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) were used with 616 adolescents in 
      Italy. A Repeated measure MANOVA showed biogenetic causes, social distancing, and 
      discomfort were more attributed to depression, while dangerousness to ADHD. 
      Furthermore, a Psychometric Network Analysis showed no differences between these 
      disorders in the relations among stigma's components. However, dangerousness 
      seemed to be among the nodes with the highest levels of "strength," confirming 
      previous literature that shows that dangerousness plays a major role in stigma.

TI  - Global prevalence of needle stick injuries among nurses: A comprehensive 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/jocn.16661 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nurses usually provide direct patient care. However, they account for 
      the majority of healthcare workers (HCWs) injured by needles or other sharp 
      objects. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of needle stick injuries (NSI) 
      among nurses worldwide; according to WHO regions, the socioeconomic development 
      index (SDI) of countries, and the developmental status of individual countries, 
      and in the Middle East. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We 
      searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. We calculated the pooled 
      NSI prevalence estimates using a random-effect meta-analysis with the 
      Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. The report of the study was in accordance 
      with the PRISMA 2020 statement. RESULTS: The overall worldwide NSI prevalence 
      pooled from our analysis was 40.97% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 31.29-50.63%, 
      p = .00001). A subgroup analysis of NSI prevalence according to WHO regions 
      revealed the highest prevalence in Southeast Asia (49.9%, 95% CI: [23.4-76.3%]) 
      and the lowest in the United States of America (25.1%, 95% CI: [18.1-32.1%]), 
      respectively. The pooled prevalence in developed and developing countries was 
      30.5% (95% CI: 27.3-33.8%) and 46.6% (95% CI: 33.7-59.5%), respectively. 
      According to the SDI, NSI prevalence was highest in low-middle SDI countries 
      (48.9% [95% CI: 30.7-67.2%]). CONCLUSION: Our results showed a high NSI 
      prevalence among nurses worldwide. Developing countries had a significantly 
      higher NSI prevalence than developed countries, especially low-middle SDI 
      countries. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlighted the prevalence 
      of NSI risk among nurses practising in clinical settings worldwide. The study 
      findings suggest that continuous training programs should be implemented for 
      nurses to enhance their knowledge, performance and attitude toward NSI prevention 
      in clinical settings. NO PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Contributions from 
      patients or the public are irrelevant because the purpose of this study was to 
      examine the global prevalence of NSIs in nurses.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA copy number is a potential biomarker for treatment choice 
      between metformin and acarbose.
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2877 [doi]
AB  - Metformin is the first-line drug for type 2 diabetes (T2D) whilst acarbose is 
      suggested as a viable alternative in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2D. 
      However, little biomarkers had been established to guide the choice between these 
      two agents. mtDNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) is a biomarker of mitochondrial 
      function, which was associated with various metabolic outcomes. Using data from 
      the trial of Metformin (n = 214) and AcaRbose (n = 198) in Chinese as the initial 
      Hypoglycaemic treatment (MARCH), we examined whether mtDNA-CN was associated with 
      response to the drugs in terms of glycaemic response and β-cell function 
      protection response. The glycaemic response is defined as the maximum glucose 
      reduction of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, or postprandial blood glucose during 
      48 weeks, respectively. β-cell function protection response is defined as the 
      maximum increment of insulinogenic index (IGI) or disposition index (DI). For all 
      three glycaemic responses, mtDNA-CN was not significantly associated with either 
      metformin or acarbose. Importantly, for β-cell function protection response, we 
      found the increased mtDNA-CN was significantly associated with more IGI increment 
      (Beta: 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02 - 1.66) in the metformin group, 
      but less IGI increment (Beta: -1.38; 95%CI: -2.52- -0.23) in the acarbose group. 
      A significant interaction (P = 0.008) between mtDNA-CN and the treatment group 
      was observed. Consistent results were also obtained when DI increment was used as 
      a measure of β-cell function response. This study demonstrated the potential 
      application of mtDNA-CN in guiding the treatment choice between metformin and 
      acarbose based on beta-cell protection.

TI  - Approach and Management of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome in Operative Head and Neck 
      Cancer Patients.
LID - 10.1002/ohn.164 [doi]
AB  - Postoperative head and neck cancer patients are at increased risk for alcohol 
      withdrawal syndrome. Literature has shown that in this patient population, 
      alcohol withdrawal is associated with an increase in postoperative medical and 
      surgical complications, length of hospitalization, and hospital-related costs. 
      Harm reduction and addiction medicine philosophies can reduce morbidity and 
      mortality, but have not been fully validated in perioperative surgical management 
      for head and neck cancer. This commentary synthesizes key principles of addiction 
      medicine and current strategies that Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 
      surgeons can consider in their perioperative assessment and management of alcohol 
      withdrawal syndrome in their patients.

TI  - The real unmet need: A multifactorial approach for identifying sensitized kidney 
      candidates with low access to transplant.
PG  - e14946
LID - 10.1111/ctr.14946 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At the start of 2020, the kidney waiting list consisted of 2,526 
      candidates with a CPRA of 99.9% or greater, a cohort demonstrated in published 
      research to have meaningfully lower than average access to transplantation even 
      under the revised kidney allocation system (KAS). METHODS: This was a 
      retrospective analysis of US kidney registrations using data from the OPTN 
      [Reference (https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/about-data/)]. The 
      period-prevalent study cohort consisted of US kidney-alone registrations who 
      waited at least one day between April 1, 2016, when HLA DQ-Alpha and DP-Beta 
      unacceptable antigen data became available in OPTN data collection, to December 
      31, 2019. Poisson rate regression was used to model deceased donor kidney 
      transplant rates per active year waiting and using an offset term to account for 
      differential at-risk periods. Median time to transplant was estimated for each 
      IRR group using the Kaplan Meier method. Sensitivity analyses were included to 
      address geographic variation in supply-to-demand ratios and differences in 
      dialysis time or waiting time. RESULTS: In this study, we found 1,597 additional 
      sensitized (CPRA 50-<99.9 %) candidates with meaningfully lower than average 
      access to transplant when simultaneously taking into account CPRA and other 
      factors. In combination with CPRA, candidate blood type, Estimated 
      Post-Transplant Survival Score (EPTS), and presence of other antibody 
      specificities beyond those in the current, 5-locus CPRA were found to influence 
      the likelihood of transplant. CONCLUSION: In total, this suggests approximately 
      4,100 sensitized candidates are on the waiting list who represent a community of 
      disadvantaged patients who may benefit from progressive therapies and 
      interventions to facilitate incompatible transplantation. Though associated with 
      higher risks, such interventions may nevertheless be more attractive than 
      remaining on dialysis with the associated accumulation of mortality risk over 
      time. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Investigation of the Potential Mutagenicity of Ethyl tertiary- Butyl Ether in the 
      Tumor Target Tissue Using Transgenic Big Blue Fischer 344 Rats Following Whole 
      Body Inhalation Exposure.
LID - 10.1002/em.22535 [doi]
AB  - Ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE) is a fuel oxygenate used for the efficiency of 
      motor vehicle fuels and their octane ratings. ETBE has been reported to induce 
      liver adenomas in male rats in a 2-year bioassay at the highest inhalation 
      concentration tested of 5000 ppm. To investigate the potential mutagenicity of 
      ETBE in the liver, male Big Blue Fischer 344 rats were exposed for 28 consecutive 
      days (6 h/day) to 0, 500, 1500, and 5000 ppm ETBE. The treated rats were 
      sacrificed 3 days post-exposure and the frequencies of cII mutants were evaluated 
      in the liver and bone marrow tissues. The mutant frequency (MF) of the liver in 
      the negative control group was 36.3 x 10(-6) and this value was not significantly 
      different from ETBE-exposed animals (39.4, 37.3, and 45.9 x 10(-6) in 500, 1500, 
      and 5000 ppm groups, respectively). In the bone marrow, the mean MF in the 
      negative control was 32.9 x 10(-6) which was not different from the means of the 
      exposed groups (33.8, 22.6, and 32.0 x 10(-6) for groups exposed to 500, 1500 and 
      5000 ppm, respectively). These data, along with consistent negative response 
      reported in the literature for other apical genotoxicity endpoints informs that 
      mutagenicity is not likely the initial key event in the mode of action for 
      ETBE-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat. This article is protected by

TI  - Time to complain about pain. Children's self-reported procedural pain in a 
      randomised control trial of Hall and conventional stainless-steel crown 
      techniques.
LID - 10.1111/ipd.13059 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children's pain in dentistry has undesirable short- and long-term 
      consequences; therefore, less invasive treatments merit consideration. AIM: To 
      investigate procedural pain scores for two treatments for carious primary molars 
      in New Zealand primary care. DESIGN: Split-mouth randomised control trial, 
      secondary outcome analysis. Children (4-8-years) with proximal carious lesions on 
      matched primary molars had one tooth treated with the Hall technique (HT), and 
      one treated with a conventional stainless-steel crown (CT); treatment type and 
      order of treatment were randomly allocated (allocation concealment). The 
      Wong-Baker self-report pain scale measured pretreatment dental pain, procedural 
      pain at each treatment, and post-operative pain. RESULTS: Data were analysed for 
      103 children; 49 children had HT first, and 54 children had CT first. Procedural 
      pain scores did not differ by treatment type, with 71.8% and 76.7% of children 
      reporting low pain for HT and CT respectively. Fewer children reported low 
      procedural pain for the second treatment than the first (p=0.047). Most children 
      reported low procedural pain for both treatments (58.3%), although 41.7% 
      experienced moderate-high procedural pain with at least one treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The HT caused pain for as many children as the CT. There is an 
      opportunity for better dental pain management in this setting.

TI  - Lack of hydroxyurea-associated mutagenesis in pediatric sickle cell disease 
      patients.
LID - 10.1002/em.22536 [doi]
AB  - Hydroxyurea is approved for treating children and adults with sickle cell anemia 
      (SCA). Despite its proven efficacy, concerns remain about its mutagenic and 
      carcinogenic potential that hamper its widespread use. Cell culture- and 
      animal-based investigations indicate that hydroxyurea's genotoxic effects are due 
      to indirect clastogenicity in select cell types when high dose and time 
      thresholds are exceeded [reviewed by Ware and Dertinger, 2021]. The current study 
      extends these preclinical observations to pediatric patients receiving 
      hydroxyurea for treatment of SCA. First, proof-of-principle experiments with 
      testicular cancer patients exposed to a cisplatin-based regimen validated the 
      ability of flow cytometric blood-based micronucleated reticulocyte (MN-RET) and 
      PIG-A mutant reticulocyte (MUT RET) assays to detect clastogenicity and gene 
      mutations, respectively. Second, these biomarkers were measured in a 
      cross-sectional study with 26 SCA patients receiving hydroxyurea and 13 SCA 
      patients without exposure. Finally, a prospective study was conducted with 10 SCA 
      patients using pre-treatment blood samples and after 6 or 12 months of therapy. 
      Cancer patients exposed to cisplatin exhibited increased MN-RET within days of 
      exposure, while the MUT RET endpoint required more time to reach maximal levels. 
      In SCA patients, hydroxyurea induced MN-RET in both the cross-sectional and 
      prospective studies. However, no evidence of PIG-A gene mutation was found in 
      hydroxyurea-treated children, despite the fact that the two assays use the same 
      rapidly-dividing, highly-exposed cell type. Collectively, these results reinforce 
      the complementary nature of MN-RET and MUT RET biomarkers, and indicate that 
      hydroxyurea can be clastogenic but was not mutagenic in young patients with SCA.

TI  - Use of Multiple-Select Multiple-Choice Items in a Dental Undergraduate 
      Curriculum: Retrospective Application of Different Scoring Methods.
LID - 10.2196/43792 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scoring and awarding credit on multiple-select items is more complex 
      than on single-choice items. Forty-one different scoring methods were 
      retrospectively applied to two multiple-select multiple-choice item types (Pick-N 
      and Multiple-True-False [MTF] items) from existing exam data. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to calculate and compare mean scores for both item types by applying 
      different scoring methods, and to investigate the effect of item quality on mean 
      raw scores and the likelihood of resulting scores at or above pass-level (≥0.6). 
      METHODS: Items and responses from examinees (ie, marking events) were retrieved 
      from previous examinations. Different scoring methods were retrospectively 
      applied to the existing exam data to calculate corresponding examination scores. 
      In addition, item quality was assessed using a validated checklist. Statistical 
      analysis was performed using Kruskal Wallis test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and 
      multiple logistic regression analysis (P<.05). RESULTS: 1,931 marking events on 
      48 Pick-N items and 828 marking events on 18 MTF items were analysed. For both 
      item types, scoring results widely differed between scoring methods (min: 0.02, 
      max: 0.98, P<.001). Both the use of an inappropriate item type (N = 34 items) and 
      presence of cues (N = 30 items) impacted on the scoring results: Pick-N items 
      used inappropriately resulted in lower mean raw scores (0.88 vs 0.93, P<.001), 
      while inappropriately used MTF items resulted in higher mean raw scores (0.88 vs 
      0.85, P=.001). MTF items with cues resulted in higher mean raw scores than items 
      without cues (0.91 vs 0.8, P<.001) while mean raw scores from Pick-N items with 
      and without cues did not differ (0.89 vs 0.90, P=.09). Item quality also impacted 
      on the likelihood of resulting scores at or above pass-level (OR≤6.977). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Educators should pay attention when using multiple-select 
      multiple-choice items and select the most appropriate item type. Different item 
      types, scoring methods, and presence of cues are likely to impact on examinees' 
      scores and overall examination results.

      in mild acne vulgaris patients: a randomized, investigator-blinded exploratory 
      study.
LID - 10.1111/exd.14779 [doi]
AB  - The effects of topical non-antibiotic acne treatment on skin microbiota have 
      rarely been demonstrated. In the study, we randomized 45 mild acne vulgaris 
      participants into 3 treatment groups, including a cream-gel dermocosmetic 
      containing Aqua Posae Filiformis, lipohydroxy acid, salicylic acid, linoleic 
      acid, niacinamide and piroctone olamine (DC), retinoic acid 0.025% cream (VAA), 
      and benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel (BP). At months 0, 1 and 3, skin specimens were 
      swabbed from the cheek and forehead and sequenced by targeting V3-V4 regions of 
      the 16S rRNA gene. QIIME2 was used to characterize bacterial communities. Acne 
      severity, sebum level, and tolerability were assessed concomitantly in each 
      visit. We found that both VAA and BP could significantly reduce the bacterial 
      diversity at month 1 (P-value=0.010 and 0.004, respectively), while no 
      significant reduction was observed in DC group. The microbiota compositions also 
      significantly altered for beta diversity in all treatments (all P-value=0.001). 
      An increased Cutibacterium with decreased Staphylococcus relative abundance was 
      observed at month 1 and 3 in DC group, while an opposite trend was demonstrated 
      in VAA and BP groups. These findings suggest a potential impact of DC, VAA, and 
      BP on the diversity and composition profiles of the skin microbiota in mild acne 
      participants.

TI  - Assessing the Suitability of Unmet Need as a Proxy for Access to Contraception 
      and Desire to Use It.
LID - 10.1111/sifp.12233 [doi]
AB  - Unmet need for contraception is a widely used but frequently misunderstood 
      indicator. Although calculated from measures of pregnancy intention and current 
      contraceptive use, unmet need is commonly used as a proxy measure for (1) lack of 
      access to contraception and (2) desire to use it. Using data from a survey in 
      Burkina Faso, we examine the extent to which unmet need corresponds with and 
      diverges from these two concepts, calculating sensitivity, specificity, and 
      positive/negative predictive values. Among women assigned conventional unmet 
      need, 67 percent report no desire to use contraception and 61 percent report 
      access to a broad range of affordable contraceptives. Results show unmet need has 
      low sensitivity and specificity in differentiating those who lack access and/or 
      who desire to use a method from those who do not. These findings suggest that 
      unmet need is of limited utility to inform family planning programs and may be 
      leading stakeholders to overestimate the proportion of women in need of expanded 
      family planning services. We conclude that more direct measures are feasible at 
      the population level, rendering the proxy measure of unmet need unnecessary. 
      Where access to and/or desire for contraception are the true outcomes of 
      interest, more direct measures should be used.

TI  - Assessment of Exercise Capacity of Individuals with Long COVID: A Cross-sectional 
      Study.
PG  - 83-87
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical investigations of long-term effects of coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) are rarely translated to objective findings. OBJECTIVES: To 
      assess the functional capacity of individuals reported on deconditioning that 
      hampered their return to their pre-COVID routine. METHODS: Assessment included 
      the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the 30-second sit-to-stand test (30-STST). We 
      compared the expected and observed scores using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 
      Predictors of test scores were identified using linear regression models. 
      RESULTS: We included 49 individuals, of whom 38 (77.6%) were recovering from mild 
      COVID-19. Twenty-seven (55.1%) individuals had a 6MWT score lower than 80% of 
      expected. The average 6MWT scores were 129.5 ± 121.2 meters and 12.2 ± 5.0 
      repeats lower than expected scores, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). The 6MWT 
      score was 107.3 meters lower for individuals with severe COVID-19 (P = 0.013) and 
      rose by 2.7 meters per each 1% increase in the diffusing capacity of carbon 
      monoxide (P = 0.007). The 30-STST score was 3.0 repeats lower for individuals who 
      reported moderate to severe myalgia (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with 
      long COVID who report on deconditioning exhibit significantly decreased physical 
      capacity, even following mild acute illness. Risk factors include severe COVID-19 
      and impaired diffusing capacity or myalgia during recovery.

TI  - Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency and COVID-19 Mortality, ICU 
      Admission, and Length of Hospitalization.
PG  - 88-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severe 
      consequences in terms of mortality and morbidity. Knowledge of factors that 
      impact COVID-19 may be useful in the search for treatments. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the effect of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency on 
      morbidly and mortality associated with COVID-19. METHODS: All patients admitted 
      to Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center between 01 March 2020 and 03 May 
      2021 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. We retrospectively retrieved 
      demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from the hospital's electronic medical 
      records. The main outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, 
      and severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: The presence of G6PD deficiency emerged as an 
      independent protective predictor for ICU admission (odds ratio [OR] 0.258, 95% 
      confidence interval [95%CI] 0.077-0.619, P = 0.003) and the development of 
      critical illness (OR 0.121, 95%CI 0.005-0.545, P = 0.006). Moreover, patients 
      with G6PD deficiency had a trend toward lower mortality rates that did not reach 
      statistical significance (OR 0.541, 95%CI 0.225-1.088, P = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients with G6PD deficiency were less likely to have a severe disease, had 
      lower rates of ICU admission, and trended toward lower mortality rates.

TI  - Hemiarthroplasty for Hip Fractures: Posterior or Direct Lateral Approach? 
      Advantages and Disadvantages.
PG  - 91-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several approaches are used to access the hip joint; most common are 
      the direct lateral and posterior. Little consensus exists on which to use when 
      treating hip fractures. OBJECTIVES: To compare short-term complications, 
      postoperative ambulation, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) of direct 
      lateral vs. posterior approaches in hemiarthroplasty for acute hip fractures. 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective clinical trial with 260 patients who 
      underwent bipolar hemiarthroplasty in the direct lateral or posterior approach 
      (166 and 94, respectively) between January 2017 and December 2018. The clinical 
      data included short-term complications: prosthetic dislocation, periprosthetic 
      fractures, and infection. Postoperative ambulation was collected 6 weeks 
      postoperatively; PROMS were collected for 173 patients at 2 years follow-up. 
      RESULTS: There were six dislocations overall, average time to dislocation was 22 
      days postoperative (range 4-34). Five dislocations were after the posterior 
      approach (5.3%) and one after direct lateral (0.6%) (P = 0.01). At 6 weeks 
      follow-up, inability to walk was found in 16.9% of the direct lateral group and 
      6.4% of the posterior approach group (P = 0.02). In the posterior approach group, 
      76% could walk more than 20 meters; only half of the direct lateral group could 
      (P = 0.0002). At 2 years follow-up, PROMS did not show a statistically 
      significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior approach for 
      hemiarthroplasty following femoral neck fractures allows superior ambulation to 
      the direct lateral approach only for the short-term. However, no long-term 
      clinical advantage was found. This short-term benefit does not justify the 
      increased dislocation rate in the posterior approach.

TI  - Implant-based Breast Reconstruction Infections: The Importance of Recognizing 
      Local Pathogens.
PG  - 96-100
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implant-based breast reconstruction (IBR) is the most common method 
      of reconstruction for breast cancer. Bacterial infection is a well-known risk 
      with reported rates ranging from 1% to 43%. The most common pathogens of breast 
      implant infection described in the literature are Staphylococcus aureus, 
      Staphylococcus epidermidis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. However, the 
      prevalence of other pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivity profile differs 
      profoundly in different parts of the world. OBJECTIVES: To review the current 
      literature and protocols with respect to our region and to determine a more 
      accurate antibiotic protocol aimed at our specific local pathogens. METHODS: A 
      retrospective review was conducted of all cases of clinically infected 
      implant-based breast reconstruction in our institution from June 2013 to June 
      2019, as well as review of microbiologic data from around the world based on 
      current literature. RESULTS: A total of 28 patients representing 28 clinically 
      infected implant-based breast reconstruction were identified during the studied 
      period. Thirteen patients (46.4%) had a positive bacterial culture growth, with 
      P. aeruginosa being the most common microorganism identified (46.1%). Review of 
      international microbiological data demonstrated significant variation at 
      different places and time periods. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiological data in cases of 
      infected breast reconstructions should be collected and analyzed in every medical 
      center and updated every few years due to the variations observed. These data 
      will help to adjust the optimal empirical antibiotic regimens given to patients 
      presenting with infections after breast reconstruction.

TI  - Acute Appendicitis Non-Operative Management Rate Trends Over Two Decades (2000 to 
      2019): The Israel experience.
PG  - 101-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis (AA) is a medical emergency. The standard of care 
      for AA had been surgical appendectomy. Recently, non-operative management (NOM) 
      has been considered, mainly for uncomplicated AA. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate AA NOM 
      trends over two decades. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based 
      on Israel's National Hospital Discharges Database (NHDD). Inclusion criteria were 
      AA admissions from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2019, with either primary 
      discharged diagnosis of AA, or principal procedure of appendectomy. Predefined 
      groups were children (5 ≤ 18 years) and adults (≥ 18 years). We compared the last 
      decade (2010-2019) with the previous one (2000-2009). RESULTS: The overall AA 
      incidence rate over two decades was 126/100,000/year; higher in children 
      164/100,000/year than 113/100,000/year in adults. Surgery was the predominant AA 
      treatment in 91.9%; 93.7% in children and 91.1% in adults. There was an increase 
      in AA NOM rates when comparing the previous decade (5.6%) to the past decade 
      (10.2%); 3.2% vs. 9.1% in children and 6.8% vs. 10.7% in adults, respectively. 
      Annual trends revealed a mild increase in AA NOM rates. Delayed appendectomy 
      (within 90 days of AA NOM) was 19.7% overall; 17.3% in adults and 26.3% in 
      children. CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in AA NOM rates during the last 
      decade in the overall population. Since 2015, there has been a noticeable 
      increase in AA NOM rates, probably associated with World Society of Emergency 
      Surgery Jerusalem guidelines. Surgery is still the predominant treatment for AA 
      despite the increasing trend in NOM.

TI  - Epidemiology of Primary Shoulder Dislocations. A Cohort Study from a Large Health 
      Maintenance Organization: 2004 to 2019.
PG  - 106-109
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiological studies on shoulder instability evaluated 
      specific and relatively small subgroups of patients. OBJECTIVES: To determine the 
      incidence rate of primary shoulder dislocations. METHODS: Cohort analysis of 
      electronic health records from 2004 to 2019 was conducted in a urban district of 
      a major health maintenance organization (HMO) in Israel. Patients presented with 
      primary shoulder dislocation that was treated with closed reduction in any 
      medical facility within the district. Overall incidence density rates (IDR) of 
      primary shoulder dislocations and stabilization surgeries were determined. 
      RESULTS: Over a period of 16 years 13,158 patients underwent closed reduction of 
      primary shoulder dislocation. Of those, 712 shoulder stabilization surgeries were 
      performed (5%). The IDR of primary shoulder dislocations were 124 per 100,000 
      person-years. The IDR of primary shoulder stabilizations were 7 per 100,000 
      person-years. The peak in the number of dislocations was observed in those 20-29 
      years old and ≥ 60 years of. In patients under 59 years old, dislocations were 
      more common in men. In those ≥ 60 years of age, dislocations were more common in 
      women. Most shoulder stabilization surgeries were performed on young patients. 
      The annual mean time from the first dislocation to stabilization surgery linearly 
      declined to 6 months in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The IDR of primary shoulder 
      dislocations calculated from the largest HMO in Israel were 124 per 100,000 
      person-years. Shoulder dislocations had bimodal age distribution. Overall, 5% of 
      the patients (mainly young) with shoulder dislocations underwent shoulder 
      stabilization surgery during the study period.

TI  - Gastrectomy for Distal Gastric Cancer: Transitioning from an Open to a Minimally 
      Invasive Surgical Practice. A Single Surgeon Experience.
PG  - 110-116
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is the only curative option for gastric carcinoma 
      (GC). Minimally invasive techniques are gaining popularity. OBJECTIVES: To 
      present a single-surgeon's experience in transitioning from an open to a 
      minimally invasive approach, focusing on surgical and oncological outcomes. 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis including distal gastrectomy 
      patients 2012-2020 operated by a single surgeon. Two cohorts were compared: open 
      (ODG) and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG). RESULTS: Overall, 173 patients 
      were referred for gastrectomy during the study years. We excluded 80 patients 
      because they presented with non-GC tumors, underwent proximal or total 
      gastrectomy, or underwent palliative surgery. Neoadjuvant treatment was 
      administered to 62 patients (33.3%). Billroth 1 was the preferred method of 
      reconstruction (n=77, 82.8%), followed by Roux-en-Y (n=12, 13%). Fifty-one 
      patients (54.8%) underwent LDG, 42 (45.2%) underwent ODG. The LDG group had 
      significantly shorter lengths of stay (6 days, interquartile range [IQR] 1-3 5-8 
      vs. 5 days, IQR 1-3 4-6, P = 0.001, respectively), earlier return to oral feeding 
      (1 day, IQR 1-3 1-3 vs. 2 days, IQR 1-3 1-3.2, P < 0.001), and earlier removal of 
      drains (4 days, IQR 1-3 3-5.2 vs. 5 days, IQR 1-3 3.5-6.7, P < 0.001). Overall 
      lymph node yield was 30 (IQR 1-3 24-39) and was similar among groups (P = 0.647). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic techniques for resection of distal GC are feasible and 
      safe, leading to good perioperative outcomes and adequate lymph node yield.

TI  - The Role of Histological Examination of Nail Clipping in the Diagnosis of 
      Onychomycosis.
PG  - 117-121
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of onychomycosis is based on potassium hydroxide (KOH), 
      direct smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction. Nail clippings are rarely 
      used as a diagnostic tool. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate nail clippings for the 
      diagnosis of onychomycosis and to compare it to KOH smears. METHODS: Nail 
      clipping specimens of 39 patients were collected: 34 with onychomycosis proved by 
      positive culture and 5 from normal nails. The specimens were submitted to 
      histological processing and then stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and 
      Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) stains. For each nail, KOH smear was 
      also performed. Two pathologists who had no information on the KOH smear and the 
      culture results evaluated the nail clipping histology for the presence of fungal 
      element. Their assessment was compared to the KOH smear and culture results. 
      RESULTS: Of the 34 specimens that had positive culture, 25 were dermatophytes, 5 
      were molds, and 4 were candida. Clipping specimens were positive in 30 cases 
      (88%): 23/25 dermatophyte, 4/5 molds, and 3/4 candida. Pathologists were able to 
      classify the pathogens into dermatophytes and non-dermatophytes based on the 
      morphology. PAS stain results were the same as GMS in evaluation of the nail 
      specimen. KOH smear was positive in 29 nails (85%): 20/25 dermatophytes, all 5 
      molds, and 4 candida. In all five nails where the culture was negative, both 
      clipping and KOH smear did not show fungal elements. CONCLUSIONS: Nail clippings 
      can serve as a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable method for evaluation of 
      onychomycosis, comparable to KOH smear, with the advantage of pathogen group 
      identification.

TI  - The Effect of Metformin on Vitamin B12 Deficiency and Stroke.
PG  - 122-125
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a known risk factor for 
      cardiovascular disease and stroke. Metformin is an old, relatively safe, first 
      line therapy for T2DM; however, it has been associated with stroke. OBJECTIVES: 
      To study the effects of metformin use and vitamin B12 deficiency on stroke rate 
      among patients with T2DM. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of patients 
      admitted with ischemic stroke within 12 months (starting March 2020). We studied 
      the clinical impact of metformin on vitamin B12 deficiency and stroke evolution. 
      Student's t-test and ANOVA were used to compare the groups of patients and to 
      determine whether there was any direct or indirect effect of metformin use on 
      vitamin B12 deficiency and stroke. RESULTS: In total, 80 patients were admitted 
      with ischemic stroke. Clinical status and biochemical data were collected and 
      compared with healthy volunteers. There were 39 diabetic patients, 16 took 
      metformin for at least 1 year. Among those who took metformin for at least 1 
      year, 9 had vitamin B12 level < 240 pg/ml (56.2%); 23 diabetic patients did not 
      get metformin and only 4 had vitamin B12 level < 240 pg/ml (17.4%) (P = 0.014). 
      CONCLUSIONS: T2DM is a significant risk factor to the development of ischemic 
      stroke. We found an association between metformin use and vitamin B12 deficiency 
      and an association between vitamin B12 deficiency and stroke risk in patients 
      with T2DM. Diabetic patients who are taking metformin should monitor their 
      vitamin B12 level.

TI  - Comparison of intravenous 5-Fluorouracil with Oral Capecitabine in the Treatment 
      of Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Using Modern Radiation Techniques.
PG  - 126-130
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASqCC) is a rare malignancy, 
      traditionally treated with combined chemoradiation, with a continuous infusion of 
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C (MMC). Replacing intravenous (IV) 5-FU with 
      oral capecitabine (oral fluoropyrimidine) has been reported as a non-inferior 
      treatment option. However, these data are scarce, with variable results. 
      OBJECTIVES: To examine the outcome of patients with ASqCC treated with either IV 
      5-FU or capecitabine concomitantly with radiation therapy. To compare treatment 
      side effects, local recurrence, and general outcome. METHODS: We reviewed charts 
      of patients who were diagnosed with stage I-III ASqCC. All participating patients 
      received chemoradiation at the Assuta Medical Center between 2011 and 2019. 
      RESULTS: In this study, 43 patients with ASqCC were eligible; 14 received 5-FU 
      and 29 were treated with capecitabine. Basic characteristics were similar between 
      the two groups, with longer follow-up for the 5-FU group. Six months following 
      treatment, 100% (13/13 with adequate follow-up) of the 5-FU group had complete 
      clinical response, compared to 84% in the capecitabine group (21/24), P = 0.143. 
      The local recurrence incidence was higher in the 5-FU group at 23% (7, 10, 26 
      months following therapy, and none in the capecitabine group (P = 0.088). 
      Although local and hematological toxicities were similar between groups, one 
      patient receiving capecitabine died during chemoradiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Oral 
      capecitabine demonstrated non-inferior disease control in ASqCC treated with 
      chemoradiotherapy. We recommend oral capecitabine over continuous IV 5-FU in 
      locally and locally advanced ASqCC. Close monitoring of side effects is required 
      to reduce major toxicity.

TI  - Omega-3 Intake Improves Clinical Pregnancy Rate in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome 
      Patients: A Double-Blind, Randomized Study.
PG  - 131-136
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omega-3 fatty acids promote fertility in males and females and 
      constitute an important factor in the normal development of the fetus. 
      OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of omega-3 supplements during ovulation 
      induction treatment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-related 
      infertility. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind study was conducted for 60 
      treatment cycles in 34 women with PCOS-related oligo/anovulation referred to the 
      fertility clinic at the Bikur Cholim/Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, 
      who underwent ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate (50 mg). Seventeen 
      women (mean age 33.9 ± 0.9 years) received omega-3 supplements (3 × 600 mg/day) 
      and 17 received placebo capsules (mean age 32.7 ± 0.9 years) for a maximum of two 
      cycles. We recorded their characteristics and data from their serial hormonal 
      blood tests and ultrasound examinations. We also conducted both univariate and 
      multivariate analyses. The primary endpoint was conception. RESULTS: There were 
      clinical pregnancies in 8/30 (26.7%) treatment cycles for women receiving omega-3 
      supplements versus 4/30 (13.3%) cycles with placebo. Among overweight/obese women 
      (body mass index [BMI] 25-35), there were clinical pregnancies in 8/27 cycles 
      (29.6%) versus 1/19 (5.3%) with placebo (P < 0.04). For overweight/obese PCOS 
      women, omega-3, lower BMI rates, and higher values of the endometrium's thickness 
      increased the odds of becoming pregnant. No harmful side effects from the omega-3 
      treatment were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 supplements demonstrated beneficial 
      effects for fertility in women diagnosed with PCOS. Among the overweight/obese 
      participants, the increased clinical pregnancy rate was significant.

TI  - Patterns in Body Mass Index Changes in Children after Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus 
      Diagnosis.
PG  - 137-142
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus 
      (T1DM) are commonly treated with daily multiple insulin injections or an insulin 
      pump. They tend to have higher body mass index-standard deviation scores 
      (BMI-SDS) than non-diabetic children. OBJECTIVES: To identify patterns in the 
      changes in BMI in the 3 years after T1DM diagnosis, and to discover factors that 
      relate to excessive weight gain. METHODS: This retrospective study included 
      clinical and laboratory data for 194 boys and girls aged 2-18 years at the time 
      of diagnosis and at 1, 2, and 3 years after. Their BMI values were compared to 
      non-diabetic children using BMI percentile and z-score (standard deviation) based 
      on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. 
      RESULTS: Both males and females had low mean BMI-SDS at diagnosis (-0.4499 ± 
      1.38743 male, 0.3050 ± 1.29887 female) that increased after 1 year (-0.0449 ± 
      1.14772 male, 0.1451 ± 0.98893 female). Lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 1 
      year correlated with higher BMI-SDS (r = -0.215, P = 0.011). No such correlation 
      was found in the following 2 years. The daily dose of basal insulin correlated 
      with higher BMI-SDS at 1 year (r = 0.183, P = 0.026) and 3 years (r = 0.297, P < 
      0.01). No association was found between the use of an insulin pump or continuous 
      glucose monitoring and higher BMI-SDS. CONCLUSIONS: BMI-SDS of children with T1DM 
      was lower than average at the time of diagnosis and rose higher than average in 
      the 3 years following. Higher BMI-SDS was not significantly associated with sex 
      or ethnicity. The most prominent increase happened in the first year.

TI  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: GLP1 Receptor Agonists and SGLT2 Inhibitors in Patients 
      Referred to Ambulatory Consultant Cardiology Clinics.
PG  - 143-146
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like 
      peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) are new antidiabetic drugs that are 
      recommended by current guidelines as a class I novel glucose-lowering treatment 
      that improves cardiovascular outcome in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
      particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 
      adherence to the current guidelines for treatment with SGLT2i and GLP1-RA drugs 
      in patients referred to ambulatory consultant cardiology clinics with 
      pre-existing T2DM. METHODS: We studied consecutive new patients with a 
      pre-existing diagnosis of T2DM who were referred to the Clalit Health Services 
      ambulatory consultant cardiology clinic over a 6-month period. The recorded 
      information included demographics, co-morbidities, and prescribed drugs at 
      patient admission. RESULTS: During the study period, 1782 patients visited our 
      outpatient cardiology clinic. At screening, T2DM was present in 428 patients 
      (24%); 77 (18%) were being treated with SGLT2i, and 39 (9.1%) with GLP1-RA. 
      Patients receiving SGLT2i and GLP1-RA were younger and had more coronary artery 
      disease, lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction, and higher mean estimated 
      glomerular filtration rates than those who were not receiving these drugs. HbA1C 
      was > 7 in 205 (47.9%) patients and > 7.5 in 136 patients (31.8%). Body mass 
      index was > 30 kg/m2 in 231 (54%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: GLP1-RA and SGLT2i drugs 
      were found to be administered more frequently than previously reported, but they 
      are not yet satisfactorily prescribed.

TI  - Rates of Malignancy in Cytology Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules: A Single Center 
      Surgical Series.
PG  - 147-151
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the high variability in malignancy rate among cytologically 
      indeterminate thyroid nodules (Bethesda categories III-V), the American Thyroid 
      Association recommends that each center define its own categorical cancer risk. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess cancer risk in patients with cytologically indeterminate 
      thyroid nodules who were operated at our center. METHODS: In a retrospective 
      study, we analyzed the pathology results of all the patients whose fine needle 
      aspiration results showed Bethesda III-V cytology and who subsequently underwent 
      total thyroidectomy or lobectomy from December 2013 to September 2017. RESULTS: 
      We analyzed 56 patients with indeterminate cytology on fine needle aspiration. 
      Twenty-nine (52%) were defined as Bethesda III, 19 (34%) Bethesda IV, and 8 (14%) 
      Bethesda V category. Malignancy rates were 38%, 58%, and 100% for Bethesda 
      categories III, IV, and V, respectively. Most malignancies in Bethesda categories 
      III and IV were follicular in origin (follicular thyroid carcinoma and follicular 
      type papillary thyroid carcinoma), while 100% of the patients with Bethesda 
      category V were diagnosed with classical papillary thyroid carcinoma. No 
      correlation was found between sonographic and cytological criteria of nodules 
      with Bethesda categories III and IV and rates of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      found higher than expected rates of malignancy in indeterminate cytology. This 
      finding reinforces the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association to 
      establish local malignancy rates for thyroid nodules with indetermined cytology.

TI  - Comprehensive characterization of amino acids and water-soluble vitamins in a 
      pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures rat model.
PG  - e2201004
LID - 10.1002/jssc.202201004 [doi]
AB  - Epilepsy is a complex neurological disease characterized by spontaneous recurrent 
      seizures that affect around 1% of the global population. Despite the significant 
      progress in the mechanisms of epileptogenesis, there is still about 60% of cases 
      in which the cause is unknown. Thus, revealing the molecular mechanisms of 
      epileptogenesis will greatly improve the development of epilepsy treatment. Since 
      the comprehensive characterization of amino acids and water-soluble vitamins is 
      important in understanding the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy or seizures, we 
      developed two liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods to quantify 
      17 water-soluble vitamins and 46 amino acids and applied them to our 
      pentylenetetrazole-induced kindling rat model. All water-soluble vitamins were 
      detected with a linearity of r > 0.992 and limits of quantitation between 0.1 and 
      5 ng/ml except for nicotinic acid. For amino acids, the linearities obtained were 
      good with correlation coefficients higher than 0.99, and matrix effects were 
      between 85.3% and 110%. To handle the multidimensional data more effectively, 
      multivariate statistical analysis approaches used in non-targeted metabolomics 
      were creatively exploited in the visualization, interpretation, and exploration 
      of the results.

TI  - Metabolomics profiling of seminal plasma in obesity-induced asthenozoospermia.
LID - 10.1111/andr.13412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthenozoospermia is one of the essential causes of male infertility, 
      and its incidence is significantly higher in obese men. Due to its complex 
      etiology and unknown pathomechanism, the diagnosis and treatment of 
      obesity-induced asthenozoospermia is a prevalent problem in reproductive 
      medicine. OBJECTIVE: To explore major differential metabolites and metabolic 
      pathways in seminal plasma and pathological mechanisms for obesity-induced 
      asthenozoospermia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed nontarget metabolomic 
      studies on the seminal plasma of healthy with normal semen parameters men (HN 
      group, n = 20), obese with normal semen parameters men (ON group, n = 20) and 
      obesity-induced asthenozoospermia men (OA group, n = 20) based on gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Metabolic profilings and related 
      pathway analyses were conducted to discriminate differential metabolites and 
      metabolic pathways. RESULTS: A total of 20 differential metabolites including 
      fructose, succinic acid, aconitic acid, methylmaleic acid, glucopyranose, serine, 
      valine, leucine, phenylalanine, glycine, glutamic acid, alanine, proline and 
      threonine were identified in HN group and ON group, 24 differential metabolites 
      including glucose, fructose, pyruvic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, aconitic 
      acid, glucopyranose, glutamic acid, valine, leucine, glycine, phenylalanine, 
      lysine, citrulline, proline and alanine were produced in OA group and ON group, 
      and 28 differential metabolites including glucose, fructose, citric acid, 
      succinic acid, glucopyranose, valine, glycine, serine, leucine, phenylalanine, 
      alanine, threonine, proline, glutamic acid, citrulline, lysine and tyrosine were 
      produced in OA group and HN group. In addition, abnormal energy metabolism 
      including carbohydrate metabolism (TCA cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and 
      pyruvate metabolism) and amino acid metabolism (phenylalanine, tyrosine and 
      tryptophan biosynthesis, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism; phenylalanine 
      metabolism, etc.) were found in ON group and OA group. CONCLUSION: Obesity could 
      affect the metabolite composition in seminal plasma and abnormal energy 
      metabolism in seminal plasma mainly including carbohydrate metabolism and amino 
      acid metabolism was closely related to obesity-induced asthenozoospermia. This

TI  - A novel approach to infectious disease control and radiotherapy risk management.
LID - 10.1002/mp.16328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious disease outbreaks have always presented challenges to the 
      operation of healthcare systems. In particular, the treatment of cancer patients 
      within Radiation Oncology often cannot be delayed or compromised due to infection 
      control measures. Therefore, there is a need for a strategic approach to 
      simultaneously managing infection control and radiotherapy risks. PURPOSE: To 
      develop a systematic risk management method that uses mathematical models to 
      design mitigation efforts for control of an infectious disease outbreak, while 
      ensuring safe delivery of radiotherapy. METHODS: A two-stage Failure Mode and 
      Effect Analysis (FMEA) approach is proposed to modify radiotherapy workflow 
      during an infectious disease outbreak. In stage 1, an Infection Control FMEA 
      (IC-FMEA) is conducted, where risks are evaluated based on environmental 
      parameters, clinical interactions, and modeling of infection risk. Occupancy Risk 
      Index (ORI) is defined as a metric for infection transmission risk level in each 
      room, based on the degree of occupancy. ORI, in combination with ventilation rate 
      per person (R(p) ), is used to provide a broad infection risk assessment of 
      workspaces. For detailed IC-FMEA of clinical processes, Infection control failure 
      mode (ICFM) is defined to be any instance of disease transmission within the 
      clinic. Infection risk priority number (IRPN) has been formulated as a function 
      of time, distance, and degree of protective measures. Infection control measures 
      are then systematically integrated into the workflow. Since the workflow is 
      perturbed by infection control measures, there is a possibility of introducing 
      new radiotherapy failure modes or increased likelihood of existing failure modes. 
      Therefore, in stage 2, a conventional radiotherapy FMEA (RT-FMEA) should be 
      performed on the adjusted workflow. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic was used to 
      illustrate stage 1 IC-FMEA. ORI and R(p) values were calculated for various 
      workspaces within a clinic. A deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) CT simulation 
      was used as an example to demonstrate detailed IC-FMEA with ICFM identification 
      and IRPN evaluation. A total of 90 ICFMs were identified in the DIBH simulation 
      process. The calculated IRPN values were found to be progressively decreasing for 
      workflows with minimal, moderate, and enhanced levels of protective measures. 
      CONCLUSION: The framework developed in this work provides tools for radiotherapy 
      clinics to systematically assess risk and adjust workflows during the evolving 
      circumstances of any infectious disease outbreak. This article is protected by

TI  - Antisolvent-Assisted In-Situ Cation Exchange of Perovskite Quantum Dots for 
      Efficient Solar Cells.
PG  - e2212160

AB  - Cesium-formamidinium lead iodide perovskite quantum dots (FA(x) Cs(1-x) PbI(3) 
      PQDs) show high potential for next-generation photovoltaics due to their 
      outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, achieving composition-tunable 
      hybrid PQDs with desirable charge transport remains a significant challenge. 
      Herein, by leveraging an antisolvent-assisted in-situ cation exchange of PQDs, 
      homogeneous FA(x) Cs(1-x) PbI(3) PQDs with controllable stoichiometries and 
      surface ligand chemistry are realized. Meanwhile, the crystallographic stability 
      of PQDs is substantially improved by substituting the cations of the PQDs 
      mediated by surface vacancies. Consequently, PQD solar cell delivers an 
      efficiency of 17.29%, the highest value among the homo-structured PQD solar 
      cells. The high photovoltaic performance is attributed to the broadened light 
      harvesting spectra, flattened energy landscape and rationalized energy levels of 
      highly oriented PQD solids, leading to efficient charge carrier extraction. This 
      work provides a feasible approach for the stoichiometry regulation of PQDs to 
      finely tailor the optoelectronic properties and tolerance factors of PQDs toward 
      high-performing photovoltaics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

      controlled trial.
PG  - 4-8
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.3771 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of primary versus secondary closure of stoma 
      reversal skin wound in terms of wound infection. METHODS: The study was conducted 
      at Surgical B Unit of Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad, Pakistan, from January 
      1 to December 31, 2020, and comprised adult patients of either gender undergoing 
      stoma reversal. The patients were randomised into primary closure group A and 
      secondary closure group B. Surgical procedure was similar in both the groups 
      except the skin closure technique. In group A, skin was closed with interrupted 
      polypropylene sutures, while in group B, wound was dressed with saline-soaked 
      gauze daily using aseptic technique and was allowed to heal by secondary 
      intention or delayed primary closure later on. Postoperatively, the wound was 
      assessed for infection till 30th postoperative day or complete wound healing. 
      Data was analysed using SPSS 16. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 35(70%) were males 
      and 15(30%) were females. The overall mean age was 28±1.65years. There were 
      25(50%) patients in each of the two groups. There were 19(76%) males and 6(24%) 
      females in group A with a mean age of 32±2.8years. There were 16(64%) males and 
      9(36%) females in group B with a mean age of 23±3.5years. Overall, 10(20%) 
      patients had wound-site infections; 9(36%) in group A versus 1(4%) in group B 
      (p=0.005). Frequency of wound infection with respect to gender, type of stoma and 
      length of hospital stay was not significant (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Secondary skin 
      closure was found to be associated with significantly reduced wound infection 
      rate after stoma reversal. CCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER:

LID - 10.47391/JPMA.4773 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of different cut-off values of 
      pleural fluid adenosine deaminase levels as a diagnostic method for tuberculous 
      pleural effusion. METHODS: The prospective study was conducted from 2014 to 2016 
      at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, and comprised pleural fluid samples 
      of adult patients with and without tuberculosis which were tested for adenosine 
      deaminase levels, and divided into tuberculosis group A and non-tuberculosis 
      group B. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive 
      predictive value were calculated using different cut-offs. Data was analysed 
      using IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 21.0 (IBM Corp., 
      Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Of 155 patients, 46(29.7%) had tuberculosis; 30(65.2%) 
      males and 16(34.8%) females. Those who did not have tuberculosis were 109(70.3%); 
      69(63.3%) males and 40(36.7%) females. The adenosine deaminase levels were 
      elevated in group A compared to group B (p<0.001). The cut-off of 30U/L showed 
      the highest sensitivity (71.7%) and negative predictive value (87.4%), and a 
      specificity of 82.6%. The cut-off of 50U/L showed the highest specificity (89.9%) 
      with sensitivity 52.2%, and the cut-off of 40U/L showed the highest positive 
      predictive value of 68.9% with sensitivity 67.4% and specificity 87.2%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Pleural fluid adenosine deaminase testing for diagnosing 
      tuberculosis pleuritis revealed highest sensitivity and moderate specificity for 
      cut-off value of 30U/L.

      cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry, Civil 
      Hospital, Karachi, from September 2020 to February 2021, and comprised caregivers 
      of patients with psychotic disorders. Data was collected using a questionnaire 
      that was filled up by caregivers mentioning their beliefs about the cause of the 
      disorder and subsequent help-seeking behaviour. Data was analysed using SPSS 22. 
      RESULTS: Of the 162 participants, 69(42.6%) were male and 93(52.4%) were female. 
      The overall mean age was 39.9+12.9 years. The majority 157(96.9%) subjects were 
      Muslims. In terms of beliefs, anxious personality 62(38.3%), evil eye 62(38.3%) 
      and God's will 56(34.6%) were the major choices picked. With respect to 
      help-seeking behaviour, the choices most picked were taking the patient to a 
      psychiatrist 129(79.6%), praying 108(66.6%) and taking the patient to a family 
      physician 103(63.6%). CONCLUSIONS: There was found to be sufficient awareness 
      among the caregivers, but help-seeking behaviour needed to improve considerably.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the persistence of symptoms and health-related quality of 
      life of coronavirus disease-2019 patients. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was 
      conducted from April to September 2020 at Health Sciences University, Yedikule 
      Chest Diseases Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, and comprised patients of either 
      gender who had to be hospitalised and treated for coronavirus disease-2019. Those 
      who had spent <3 months (46-90 days) post-discharge formed Group 1, those having 
      spent 3-6 were in Group 2, while those with >6 months post-discharge were in 
      Group 3. Data was collected over the telephone Using the EuroQol's quality of 
      life scale with 5 dimensions and 5 levels. The variables likely to affect the 
      persistence of symptoms and the quality of life questionnaire scores were 
      analysed using SPSS 16. RESULTS: Of the 225 subjects, 135(60%) were male and 
      90(40%) were female. The overall mean age was 55.7±19.91 years. There were 
      85(37.8%) participants in Group 1, 83(36.9%) in Group 2, and 57(25.3%) in Group 
      3. The age (p=0.09) and gender (p=0.23) distribution across the groups had no 
      significant difference. Patients were called on an average 131.72±58.9 days after 
      discharge (range: 46-279 days). Only 52 (23.1%) patients continued to show 
      symptoms. Anxiety was the domain in which most patients 64(28.4%) reported 
      deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients who have had coronavirus 
      disease-2019COVID-19 after a long follow-up period did not show any symptoms or 
      had any significant deterioration in their quality of life.

TI  - Evaluation of organ weights and ventricular thicknesses in electrocution related 
      deaths based on autopsy reports: A biophysical approach.
PG  - 33-36
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.5191 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate autopsy reports of the deaths due to electrocution in 
      terms of body mass index, body surface area, and organ weights with a biophysical 
      perspective. METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted in Malatya, Turkiye, 
      and comprised autopsy reports of electrocution cases that were obtained from the 
      local branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine related to the period from 2012 
      to 2019. Organ weights and ventricular thicknesses were compared in terms of body 
      mass index and body surface area. Electrical marks were also evaluated in detail. 
      Data was analysed using SPSS 18. RESULTS: Of the 45 cases, 36(%) were male and 
      9(%) were female. The overall mean age was 39±13 years (range: 20-71 years). 
      There were no significant differences in organ weights and ventricular 
      thicknesses in different body mass index groups (p>0.05). The weights of head and 
      heart were significantly different in relation to body surface area (p<0.05), but 
      no significant difference were found for other organs and ventricular thickness 
      (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the organ weights in electrocution autopsies to 
      normal organ weights may help decide the cause of death. During autopsy, 
      electrical marks should be evaluated by considering the characteristics of the 
      electrical current.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the development and validity assessment of a comprehensive 
      model of assessment method comprising written test and multiple mini interviews 
      for selection in a medical internship programme. METHODS: The psychometric 
      validation study was conducted at the Aga Khan University, Karachi, and comprised 
      anonymised scores of written admission test, multiple mini interviews and exit 
      written exams for all the interns who completed their internships in 2018 and 
      2019. Correlation between admission and exit tests, and predictions were 
      assessed. Data was analysed using SPSS 20. RESULTS: There were 160 interns; 
      80(50%) each in 2018 and 2019. Mean scores were 68.8±4.40% for written tests and 
      76.7±4.66% for multiple mini interviews. The mean score for exit examination was 
      68.1±6.84%. The Cronbach's alpha of scores on the written admission test was 0.82 
      and 0.88 for the two years, respectively, while for the multiple mini interviews, 
      the corresponding values were 0.81 and 0.94. The written admission and exit tests 
      were moderately correlated (0.44) while the correlations of multiple mini 
      interviews scores with written admissions and exit tests were -0.28 and 0.04, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The selection process should comprise multiple 
      measures of assessment to ensure the selection of the best candidates.

TI  - The rising menace of antifungal resistance in dermatophytes among the patients of 
      tinea capitis.
PG  - 43-48
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.5307 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the epidemiological profile of dermatophytes among 
      patients of tinea capitis and their susceptibility pattern to fluconazole and 
      terbinafine. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department 
      of Microbiology, Basic Medical Sciences Institute, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical 
      Centre, Karachi, from August to December 2019, and comprised samples of hair and 
      skin from the scalp of tinea capitis patients regardless of age and gender. 
      Demographic details were collected and the samples were processed for direct 
      microscopy and mycological culture. Antifungal susceptibility testing for 
      fluconazole and terbinafine was performed using broth microdilution method. Data 
      was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 207 patients, 115(55.5%) were males, 
      and 114(55.1%) were children. Alopecia was the most common presenting complaint 
      141(68.1%), while grey patch tinea was the most characteristic clinical form 
      53(25.6%). Dermatophytes were yielded in 61(29.5%) cases, non-dermatophytes were 
      isolated in 45(21.7%) specimens, and 101(48.8%) were culture-negative. Among the 
      dermatophytes, trichophyton violaceum was the most common pathogen 21(34.4%), 
      followed by trichophyton mentagrophytes 18(29.5%). Resistance to fluconazole and 
      terbinafine among dermatophytes was recorded in 12(19.7%) and 7(11.5%) isolates, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of dermatophytes among tinea capitis 
      patients was higher compared to non-dermatophyte species. Antifungal resistance 
      was predominantly seen in trichophyton violaceum and trichophyton mentagrophytes.

PG  - 49-53
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.5379 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate variations in the shape, diameter, length and width of the 
      nasopalatine canal along with the width of the buccal cortical bone anterior to 
      it, using cone beam computed tomography imaging. METHODS: The retrospective, 
      cross-sectional study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, 
      from September to October 2020, and comprised pre-existing cone beam computed 
      tomography scans taken between 2015 and 2020 of patients of either gender aged 
      18-60 years who had maxillary central incisors present. The shapes and dimensions 
      of the nasopalatine canal were observed along with the buccal bone anterior to 
      the nasopalatine canal. Data was compared with respect to age and gender. Data 
      was analysed using SPSS 23. RESULTS: Of the 90 scans evaluated, 46(51.1%) 
      belonged to females with a mean age of 37.85±18.19 years, and 44(48.9%) belonged 
      to males with a mean age of 38.07±13.58 years. The mean length and width of the 
      nasopalatine canal was 11.28±1.90mm and 2.62±0.91mm, respectively. The 
      nasopalatine canal was significantly longer (p<0.01) and wider (p=0.02) in males 
      than females. The mean diameter of foramen of Stenson was 2.99±1.17mm and 
      incisive foramen was 6.09±1.80mm. The mean width of the buccal cortical bone at 
      the most coronal, middle and most incisal levels was 7.20±1.70mm, 6.12±1.31mm and 
      6.12±1.31mm, respectively. Buccal bone width was wider in males than females, but 
      the difference was significant only at the midpoint (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There 
      was a significant difference in the dimensions of the width and length of the NPC 
      with respect to gender. No significant differences were observed with respect to 
      age.

LID - 10.47391/JPMA.5532 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anatomical outcome of tectonic grafts performed in 
      children with perforated or melted corneas. METHODS: The prospective study was 
      conducted at the Department of Paediatric Ophthalmology, Al-Shifa Trust Eye 
      Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from January to December 2017, and comprised 
      children of either gender aged <16 years who received tectonic grafts owing to 
      desmetocoele or corneal perforation of >3mm. The causes of corneal perforation, 
      size of perforation, post-operative graft outcome and globe integrity were noted. 
      Periodic follow-ups were done till December 2019. Data was analysed using SPSS 
      22. RESULTS: Of the 27 patients, 9(33.3%) were girls and 18(66.7%) were boys. The 
      overall mean age was 47.7±43.5 months. The most common indication was corneal 
      perforation 19(70.4%), followed by descemetocoele 8(29.6%). The most frequent 
      cause was infectious keratitis 13(48.2%), followed by trauma 8(29.6%) and vitamin 
      A deficiency 5(18.5%). The mean size of perforation/descemetocoele was 5.5±1.5mm. 
      Post-operatively, graft failure occurred in 5(18.5%) eyes and required repeat 
      grafts. Globe integrity was restored in all 27(100%) cases, and 24(88.8%) eyes 
      maintained their size and intraocular pressure, while 3(11.1%) became phthisical. 
      Post-operative visual acuity was better than 6/36 in 3(11.1%) eyes, between 6/36 
      and 6/60 in 10(37%) and counting finger in 14(51.8%). CONCLUSION: Tectonic graft 
      was found to be a valuable therapeutic option in emergency globe-threatening 
      corneal thinning and perforation and in maintaining the anatomical integrity of 
      eyes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between capillary blood oxygen 
      saturation and computerised tomography severity index in patients with 
      coronavirus disease-2019 pneumonia. METHODS: The cross-sectional analytical study 
      was conducted at the coronavirus disease-2019 ward of Nishtar Medical University 
      and Hospital, Multan, Pakistan, June 1, 2020, to June 1, 2021. At the time of 
      admission, capillary oxygen saturation of all patients was measured. Pulmonary 
      computerised tomography scans were then performed, and computerised tomography 
      severity index was calculated. Data was analysed using SPSS 18. RESULTS: Of the 
      170 patients, 90 (52.9%) were males and 80(47%) were females. The overall mean 
      age of the sample was 56.32±12.45 years. At the time of admission, the mean 
      oxygen saturation was 88.9±6.53% and the mean severity index was 15.01±7.79. 
      Overall, 22(12.9%) patients had hypoxia and the severity index reading was 
      significantly high in these patients (p=0.001). Chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease, hypertension and diabetes were significantly related to reduced blood 
      oxygen saturation (p<0.05). Patients with hypertension had significantly raised 
      computerised tomography scores. A significant inverse correlation was found 
      between capillary oxygen saturation and computerised tomography severity index 
      (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A significant inverse correlation was found between 
      capillary oxygen saturation and computerised tomography severity index. 
      Underlying comorbidities also affected the severity index.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term and sustained intraocular pressure changes 
      after intravitreal bevacizumab in patients with diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: 
      The quasi-experimental study was conducted at the District Headquarter Teaching 
      Hospital, Gujranwala, Pakistan, from January to December 2020, and comprised 
      diabetic patients of either gender aged 18-60 years with indication for 
      intravitreal bevacizumab. Intraocular pressure was measured at 5, 10 and 30 
      minutes for short-term elevation, and the patients were followed up weekly for 
      one month to record any sustained elevation in intraocular pressure. Data was 
      analysed using SPSS 25. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients, 20(47.61%) were male and 
      22(52.38%) were female. The overall mean age was 52.4±5.7 years. Intraocular 
      pressure increased significantly in the short term post-injection (p<0.001), 
      while the difference was not significant in the weekly check-ups (p=0.264). 
      CONCLUSION: There was short-term rise in intraocular pressure after intravitreal 
      bevacizumab, but no sustained elevation was noted over the following month.

PG  - 69-73
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.6112 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the efficacy of preoperative intravenous injection of 120mg 
      of methylprednisolone acetate steroid on the formation of seroma after modified 
      radical mastectomy in breast cancer patients. METHOD: The case-control study was 
      conducted at Ward 3, Surgical Unit 1, Department of General Surgery, Jinnah 
      Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, from November 2020 to April 2021, and 
      comprised female patients with biopsy-proven carcinoma of breast who were 
      scheduled for elective definitive breast cancer surgery. The subjects were 
      randomised into treatment group A and control group B. Group A was given a single 
      dose of intravenous injection methylprednisolone acetate 120mg half-an-hour 
      before surgery, while group B underwent similar surgery without the said 
      injection. Seroma was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
      Events v3.0. The groups were compared for age, total drainage, duration of 
      drainage, seroma grading and wound status. Data was analysed using SPSS 25. 
      RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, there were 30(50%) in each of the two groups. The 
      age difference between groups was non-significant (p=0.346). There was a 
      significant difference in the mean total drainage volume and mean duration of 
      drainage between the groups (p=0.001). Seroma formation, seroma grading and wound 
      status were not significantly different between the groups (p>0.05). The efficacy 
      in treatment was high in group A (odds ratio: 2.78; 95% confidence interval: 
      0.65-13.94). CONCLUSIONS: A single preoperative dose of Injection 
      methylprednisolone acetate was effective in terms of post-mastectomy outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of agenesis of palmaris longus muscle and 
      its association with gender and hand dominance. METHODS: The cross-sectional 
      descriptive study was conducted at the Bahria University Medical and Dental 
      College, Karachi, from March 2021 to November 2021, and comprised medical 
      students of either gender from 1st, 2nd and 3rd year of studies. Clinical 
      examination of palmaris longus was done by using the classic Schaeffer's test, 
      and it was confirmed using the Thompson's test. The agenesis of palmaris longus 
      muscle and its association with gender and hand dominance was also tested. Data 
      was analysed using SPSS 23. RESULTS: Of the 200 participants, 114(57%) were 
      female and 86(43%) were male. The overall age range was 18-23 years. Of the 
      total, 195(97.5%) subjects were right hand dominant and 5(2.5%) were left hand 
      dominant. Agenesis was found in 67(33.5%) subjects with no significant difference 
      in terms of gender or hand dominance (p>0.05). Statistically significant 
      difference (p=0.01) was found related to bilateral agenesis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Bilateral agenesis was found significantly more in females compared to the males, 
      while palmaris longus agenesis and hand dominance had no significant association.

LID - 10.47391/JPMA.6303 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between gross motor function of children 
      with cerebral palsy and quality of life of their primary caregivers. METHODS: The 
      cross-sectional analytical study was conducted from December 2020 to August 2021 
      at the Sindh Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and the Rabia Moon 
      Trust, Karachi, and comprised children with cerebral palsy and their caregivers. 
      The children were assessed on the basis of Gross Motor Function Measure-66 and 
      Gross Motor Functional Classification System, while the caregivers were asked to 
      complete the self-administered World Health Organisation Quality of Life-BREF 
      questionnaire. All the categorical variables were presented through frequencies 
      and percentages. Spearman's Correlation was applied to evaluate the correlation. 
      Data was analysed using SPSS 16. RESULTS: Of the 43 children, 26(60.5%) were male 
      and 17(39.5%) were females. The overall mean age was 5.70±1.820 years. Among the 
      caregivers, 40(93%) were females and 3(7%) were males. The mean age of the 
      caregivers was 27.70±4.77 years. None of domains of quality of life showed 
      significant correlation with total score of Gross Motor Function Measure-66 
      (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The disease severity among children with cerebral palsy 
      was not a factor associated with quality of life of the caregivers. The physical 
      health was relatively lower among the caregivers, but it was not associated with 
      motor disabilities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the mandibular ramal height differences between clinically 
      symmetrical and asymmetrical face individuals. METHODS: The comparative 
      cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2020 to July 2021 at the Armed 
      Forces Institute of Dentistry, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and comprised subjects 
      regardless of age and gender who were divided into two equal groups. Those with a 
      clinically symmetrical face were in Group-I, and those with a clinically 
      asymmetrical face were in Group-II. Mandibular ramal height of both sides of all 
      subjects was measured, and asymmetry index. Differences of both right and left 
      ramal heights of each group were measured and compared. Data was analysed using 
      SPSS 26. RESULTS: Of the 78 subjects, 40(51%) were males and 38(49%) were 
      females. The overall mean age was 18±5.78 years, with 44(56%) aged 16-25 years, 
      28(36%) <15 years and 6(8%) >26 years. There was high but non-significant 
      correlation between the right and left sides of both the groups (p>0.05). 
      Inter-group differences were significant with respect to ramal height (p=0.000), 
      whereas difference in terms of asymmetry index was not significant (p>0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the mean ramal height between 
      clinically symmetrical and asymmetrical face individuals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the awareness of individuals about coronavirus 
      disease-2019 disease and vaccines during the pandemic. METHODS: The descriptive, 
      cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at family health centres in the 
      Bursa province of Turkiye from July 1 to 7, 2021. The face-to-face survey of 
      registered individuals had 20 items that measured coronavirus disease-2019 and 
      vaccines. The scale was named the Coronavirus Disease-2019 and Vaccine Awareness 
      level. It was carried out by family physicians using an online weblink. The 
      Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.87. Data was analysed using SPSS 25. RESULTS: Of 
      the 228 subjects, 129(56.6%) were males and 99(43.4%) were females. The overall 
      mean age was 27.82±10.28 years. Awareness levels were high with a mean value of 
      2.41±0.31. Female participants were more aware than males (p=0.04) and those with 
      monthly income between 2000-10000 Turkish lira had lower awareness level compared 
      to other income groups (p=0.03). Marital status (p=0.32), education level 
      (p=0.49) comorbidities (p=0.23), regular drug usage (p=0.13) and exercise status 
      (p=0.24) did not affect the awareness levels. Non-smokers were more aware than 
      the smokers (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The level of awareness about coronavirus 
      disease-2019 and its vaccine was higher in the female gender and non-smokers, it 
      was lower in the middle-income group.

      cataract surgery in a low to middle income country - a one-year audit.
PG  - 92-97
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.5207 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal injection of 
      triamcinolone and moxifloxacin regime administered immediately following cataract 
      surgery. METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted from January to June 2021 
      at a tertiary care referral centre in Karachi and comprised record of all 
      patients who underwent dropless cataract surgery from April 2018 to June 2019. 
      Data included slit lamp examination, dilated fundal exam, uncorrected visual 
      acuity, best corrected visual acuity, and intraocular pressure. Cataract 
      assessment and anterior chamber reaction were graded according to the World 
      Health Organisation cataract grouping system. Efficacy of the regime was defined 
      as the ability to prevent postoperative endophthalmitis. Stratification analysis 
      was done to note if gender has any role in terms of effectiveness. Data was 
      analysed using Microsoft Excel version 16.0 and IBM SPSS version 27. RESULTS: Of 
      240 eyes of 161 patients analysed, 114(47.5%) were of men who had a mean age of 
      57.89±14.32 years, and 126(52.5%) were of females with a mean age of 58.02±10.85 
      years. Overall, 2(1.75%) male subjects and 1(0.8%) female subject developed 
      breakthrough inflammation within one week of the procedure. They were treated 
      with anti-inflammatory drops and in 1(33%) of the cases antibiotic drop for 1 
      week. At day 90, no patient had residual inflammation or new onset inflammation. 
      Also, 15(6.25%) patients developed raised intraocular pressure from day 7 to day 
      30. Most cases 10(66.7%) resolved within 1 week of using intraocular 
      pressure-lowering drops. No patient developed endophthalmitis postoperatively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dropless cataract regime was found to be an effective and safe 
      alternative that was easy to administer.

LID - 10.47391/JPMA.5668 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic performance of bronchoscopy in patients 
      with coronavirus disease 2019 infection. METHODS: The systematic review was 
      conducted in April 2021 and comprised search of published articles and preprint 
      servers for original articles assessing diagnostic performance of bronchoscopy in 
      patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The primary outcome 
      of interest was diagnostic sensitivity of bronchoalveolar lavage in the patients. 
      The quality of each study was assessed using the Quality Assessment, Data 
      Abstraction and Synthesis-2 tool. RESULTS: Of the 29 full-text articles assessed 
      for eligibility, 4(13.8%) were included collectively comprising 209 patients who 
      had undergone bronchoalveolar lavage. Mean sensitivity of bronchoalveolar lavage 
      was 83.5% ± 10.63 (range: 68.2-940%). Overall, the 4 studies had an unclear or 
      low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data suggested that bronchoscopy with 
      bronchoalveolar lavage did not have reliably higher diagnostic sensitivity than 
      that reported for either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs.

      ASIA; a narrative review.
PG  - 106-110
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.3079 [doi]
AB  - Rabies is an infectious viral disease endemic worldwide and is fatal after the 
      onset of clinical symptoms. In 99% of cases, dogs contribute to infectious viral 
      transmission in humans. It causes approximately 10,000 deaths per year, mainly in 
      Asia and Africa, with 95% of deaths occurring in Asia alone. Currently, the 
      number of dog bite cases reported in Pakistan is alarming. Such cases are first 
      seen mostly by general practitioners. The current narrative review was planned to 
      assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of general practitioners as reported 
      in the literature from different countries published between July 2016 and 
      February 2021 regarding dog bite management. Articles were searched using Google, 
      Google Scholar, Ovid, Eric and PubMed databases. Keywords used included rabies, 
      dog bite, general practitioners, medical officers, knowledge, attitude and 
      practices. A total of 7 studies comprising 875 participants were included. 
      Because of the increasing human population, a growing number of dogs and a lack 
      of concerted efforts for the control of disease, the burden of human deaths as a 
      result of rabies will continue to escalate.

TI  - Effect of physical therapy treatment in infants treated for congenital muscular 
      torticollis - a narrative review.
PG  - 111-116
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.3852 [doi]
AB  - Congenital muscular torticollis is a problem that arises at birth or immediately 
      after birth in which the sternocleidomastoid muscle is shortened on the afflicted 
      side, leading to an ipsilateral rotated of the head and a contralateral rotation 
      of the face and jaw. To determine the effectiveness of physical therapy treatment 
      in infants treated for congenital muscular torticollis, relevant articles 
      published between 2011 and 2020 were located using electronic databases. A total 
      of 9 studies out of 24 potentially relevant articles were reviewed. All studies 
      were randomised controlled trials with 6-8 score on the Physiotherapy Evidence 
      Database scale (Pedro scale) which showed high quality of methodology. The 
      studies typically found significant statistical effects in the management of 
      congenital muscular torticollis. Additionally, most of the studies reported 
      increased adherence to exercise as another essential advantage. Conservative 
      physical therapy management showed positive outcomes, and early physiotherapy 
      referral showed significant reduction in treatment duration.

AB  - The Guillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune polyradiculoneuropathy causing 
      symmetrical weakness of limbs. After poliomyelitis, it is the second most common 
      cause of paralysis, with an annual incidence of 0.84-1.91 per 100,000 
      individuals. The syndrome affects both men and women, showing a male 
      preponderance. Campylobacter jejuni, epstein-barr virus, cytomegalovirus, 
      mycoplasma pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae are amongst the most common 
      causative agents of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Several immunological and genetic 
      factors have been recognised as the risk factors. Human leukocyte antigen, 
      cluster of differentiation 1, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha alleles are among 
      the frequently investigated loci in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Genome-wide 
      association studies have found no significant association of Guillain-Barré 
      syndrome with common variants. Many vaccines against Campylobacter jejuni 
      infection have been proposed, but there are concerns about the efficacy and 
      safety of these vaccines. So far, there is no approved vaccine against 
      Campylobacter jejuni.

LID - 10.47391/JPMA.5155 [doi]
AB  - Mental illnesses are prevalent worldwide, especially in the underdeveloped 
      countries of the South Asian region, particularly in women, where they largely 
      remain unaddressed. Evidence from the South Asian region indicates that there is 
      a high burden of mental disorders in vulnerable populations such as pregnant 
      women. Mental health problems during pregnancy and in the postpartum period are 
      twice as common in LMICs as compared to HICs. Interventions delivered by 
      community health workers (CHWs) in many health delivery and promotive initiatives 
      have played a vital role in improving mental health. CHW-based interventions are 
      cost-effective, efficient and acceptable for the local people and can strengthen 
      the overall health system. This review aimed to explore integration of maternal 
      mental health into existing maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) programs so 
      that delivery of mental health interventions can be done alongside MNCH 
      interventions. Integrating maternal mental health programmes into existing MNCH 
      programs and using digital platforms for expanding their delivery through CHWs, 
      lay counsellors, and other frontline health workers can prove to be a promising 
      strategy. Even though mHealth platforms for addressing a variety of health issues 
      have been widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of digital platforms 
      for addressing maternal mental health issues remains inadequate.

TI  - Comparison of effects of manual physical therapy and exercise therapy for 
      patients with Temporomandibular disorders.
PG  - 129-130
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.3594 [doi]
AB  - The term temporomandibular disorder is used for pain and dysfunction at the 
      temporomandibular joint. Manual therapy or exercise therapy has proven to be an 
      effective measure for pain relief. The purpose of this study was to compare the 
      effectiveness of manual therapy and exercise therapy in temporomandibular 
      disorders. A quasi-experimental study was conducted from June 30, 2020 to 
      December 30, 2020 in Al-Sheikh teaching hospital, Sialkot, Pakistan. A convenient 
      sample of 24 patients was involved in the study. Lottery method was used to 
      randomise the patients in either the Manual Therapy Group or Exercise Therapy 
      Group. The participants were assessed before and after the intervention through 
      Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for pain, Patient-Specific Functional Scale 
      (PSFS) for function, Fonesca Amnestic Index (FAI) for the severity of condition, 
      and Millimetre Mouth Opening (MMO) for ranges. The manual therapy group showed a 
      statistically significant difference in pre- and post-treatment NPRS, PSFS, FAI 
      and MMO (p< 0.0001). Manual physical therapy is more effective to improve pain, 
      ROM, function, and severity in temporomandibular disorders.

      study.
PG  - 131-134
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.4940 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia. Over the years, various IV 
      preparations of iron have been developed, including Monofer® (Iron isomaltoside 
      1000), that showed a remarkable reduction in the occurance of hypersensitivity 
      reactions. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the severity and extent to 
      which hypersensitivity reactions occur after the administration of IV iron 
      isomaltoside 1000 in an Asian population. Multistage sampling was adopted for 
      this study. The overall sample size was 864. The mean age of the participants was 
      55.29 ±18.44 years. The results depicted that 63 (7.29%) of the entire 
      participants faced hypersensitivity reactions after IV administration. A total of 
      43 (68.25%) participants who experienced hypersensitivity reactions showed 
      clinical symptoms within one hour, 11(17.46%) showed reaction in 1-3 hours and 9 
      (14.29%) showed in > 3 Hours. The majority of the studied population showed 
      significant improvement only after the administration of Pheniramine maleate, 
      while only a few of them received Hydrocortisone.

TI  - An empirical research study on deluging quackery outlets across Sindh, Pakistan 
      and propositions to deal with confounding factors of rising quackery.
PG  - 135-138
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.6050 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of medical quackery, to identify the 
      confounding factors of the rising trend, and suggest possible ways to eliminate 
      the menace. METHODS: This empirical study was conducted from July 2019 to June 
      2020 in six divisions of the Sindh province of Pakistan, and comprised field 
      inspection reports and data collection based on healthcare establishments' 
      physical inspection, verification, and action on non-compliant units. Data was 
      qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. RESULTS: Of the 3,063 healthcare 
      establishments, 568(18%) were visited in Larkana, 641(21%) in Shaheed Benazirabad 
      (SBA), 527(17%) in Mirpurkhas, 700(23%) in Hyderabad, 110(4%) in Sukkur, and 
      517(17%) in Karachi. Overall, 2,152(70%) outlets were shuttered and fined for 
      violating anti-quackery laws, while 911(30%) were issued warning notices. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The healthcare system in the Sindh province was found to be 
      struggling, with quackery continuing to proliferate.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Half-Somersault and 
      Brandt-Daroff exercises on dizziness, fear of fall, and quality of life in 
      patients with posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (PC-BPPV). 
      This study was conducted from July 2020 to November 2020. A total of 20 patients 
      were enrolled in the study, through sealed envelope method, and assigned to two 
      groups, A and B (10 in each). Vestibular activity and participation measure and 
      Fall Efficacy Scale (FES) were used. The mean age of the patients was 36.70±11.58 
      years. There was a significant (p=0.05) difference between the Vestibular 
      activities and participation measure (VAP) score at post intervention and Fall 
      Efficacy Scale (FES) (p<0.05) between the groups. Within group analysis showed 
      significant results (p=0.01). This study concluded that both manoeuvers are 
      significantly effective in the treatment of PC-BPPV, but patients treated with 
      Brandt-Daroff exercises reported more improvement in terms of quality of life and 
      residual dizziness compared to the Half Somersault group. Clinical Trials.gov 
      identifier (NCT number): NCT04469309.

      Pakistan: A quantitative approach.
PG  - 143-146
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.5143 [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to ascertain the extent of dental caries among primary 
      school children in Quetta. A total of 362 children were examined for their dental 
      and oral hygiene status. WHO recommended indexes, including Oral Hygiene 
      Index-Simplified (OHI-S) and Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT), were used 
      for dental examinations. The study results reveal a high prevalence of dental 
      caries (74%), and the mean "DMFT" score was 1.07±1.63, and "deft" score 2.29± 
      2.31. There were no significant differences among mean deft, gender, and type of 
      school (P=.27 and .07) in deciduous dentition. Public school children were 
      approximately two times more likely to have dental caries (OR 1.92; P=.021). 
      Dental caries were significantly higher among children with poor oral hygiene (OR 
      2.40; P=.005). Overall, the treatment needs of the children were noted to be over 
      90%.

LID - 10.47391/JPMA.5229 [doi]
AB  - Faculty Development (FD) embraces all educational activities used by teachers to 
      improve their knowledge and skills for enhancing their academic competencies. 
      This study aimed to identify the areas in Health Professions Education (HPE) in 
      which formal faculty development is required. A needs assessment survey was 
      conducted from among the faculty members at the Aga Khan University (AKU), 
      Karachi, Pakistan, and the French Medical Institute for Mother and Children, 
      Afghanistan. Data was analysed using SPSS 20.0 and reported frequencies and 
      percentages according to various academic tracks. Competency-based curricula 
      (51%), providing effective feedback (51%), developing Objective Structured 
      Clinical Exam (51%), and clinical supervision (48%) were identified as 
      significant areas for faculty development. Faculty in clinician teacher and 
      clinician educator track require advanced training, i.e., Masters and PhD in HPE. 
      The needs assessment facilitated prioritising the areas for FD. This will 
      contribute to enhancing academic practices and inculcating the culture of 
      lifelong learning.

AB  - Schizophrenic patients deny health care due to lack of insight in many cases. In 
      such situations most of the psychiatrists opt for covert medication in 
      consultation with the families. Covert medication has legal and ethical 
      implications. Moreover, it has certain clinical implications for the patient. In 
      addition, how long the covert medication can be continued and when should it be 
      revealed to the patient are questions that cannot be answered in black and white. 
      This article is a commentary on a real scenario of covert medication in ethical 
      perspective.

PG  - 153-156
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.02-23 [doi]
AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health concern and requires 
      nuanced health policy response for effective addressal at the subnational level. 
      Using the nationally and county level representative data from the 2019-20 
      Demographic and Health Survey of Liberia, the prevalence of IPV was computed for 
      each of the sixteen Liberian counties in 15 - 49-year-old women. Additionally, 
      prevalence of IPV acceptance and having parental IPV were also computed. 
      Prevalence of each of the three metrics were mapped by county, in addition to 
      bivariate mapping of the three attributes. Results demonstrate wide chasms in 
      prevalence at the county level. Several countries with high prevalence of one 
      metric were correlated with the high prevalence of the other two metrics, and 
      vice versa. Albeit nuanced differences in associations at the county level were 
      also observed. Findings auger for nuanced health policy measures to address IPV 
      more effectively in Liberia.

TI  - A novel way of quantifying bone defect in primary total knee replacements using 
      plain radiographs.
PG  - 157-161
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.2075 [doi]
AB  - Bone defect assessment in primary advanced knee arthritis can present a challenge 
      for the surgeon and lead to unfavourable outcomes if not adequately determined 
      during preoperative planning. The aim of this study was to introduce a new, 
      simple and quick way to assess and quantify bone defect using short film 
      radiographs and utilising it to choose the total knee prosthesis. This is a 
      prospective case series of patients who underwent TKA (Total Knee Arthroplasty) 
      using various types of prostheses. Three different angles - Tibiofemoral angle, 
      MPTA (medial proximal tibial angle), and JLCA (joint line convergence angle) - 
      were measured preoperatively to evaluate limb alignment, placement of the tibial, 
      and femoral components of total knee prosthesis. Postoperatively roentgenographic 
      index introduced by Lotke et al was used to assess our preoperative methodology. 
      The American knee society score was used pre- and postoperatively up to one year. 
      A total of eight knees of six patients were analysed (four males, two females). 
      The mean age of the patients was 57.75±5.701 years. All the knees were in varying 
      degrees of varus deformity preoperatively. The accuracy of the preoperatively 
      used radiological angles was analysed by postoperative measurement of 
      tibiofemoral angle (d), tibial anatomical axis (b) and femoral anatomical axis 
      (a), and Roentgenographic index as suggested by Lotke et al. Postoperatively, all 
      the knees were in valgus with tibiofemoral angle (d) 6.50±0.926, tibial component 
      alignment (b) mean was 89±1.195, and femoral component alignment (a) mean was 
      5.13±0.991 valgus. Mean roentgenographic index was 89.38±3.292. American knee 
      society score improved at one-year follow-up postoperatively and was 
      statistically significant with p<0.001. In this study, a new classification for 
      bone defects in primary arthritic knees by utilising simple plain radiograph 
      short films and as a guide for implant selection is proposed.

AB  - Thiamine responsive megaloblastic anaemia syndrome also known as Rogers syndrome 
      is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder. The hallmark of the disease is the 
      presence of the classic triad of anaemia, diabetes mellitus, and sensorineural 
      deafness. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented to us with severe 
      megaloblastic anaemia, diabetes mellitus, and sensorineural deafness. The anaemia 
      was further complicated by acute parvovirus infection. He was put on high doses 
      of thiamine (vitamin B1) which led to an improvement.

      Spermatic cord Leiomyosarcoma is an extremely rare intrascrotal tumour. Owing to 
      its rarity, no definitive management guidelines have been formulated as yet. The 
      majority of published literature comprises of case reports or case series and 
      show varying outcomes depending upon multiple patient- and disease-related 
      factors. Almost all cases are older adults with majority in the sixth or seventh 
      decades of life. It is commonly labelled as an indolent curable tumour if treated 
      early by radical orchiectomy. The role of lymphadenectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy 
      or chemotherapy is unclear. This case report concerns a young 38-year-old man who 
      suffered from a painless firm left hemiscrotal mass for the past two years. 
      Ultrasonography showed an intrascrotal paratesticular mass. Metastatic workup was 
      negative. Left radical orchiectomy was performed and histopathology of the 
      surgical specimen revealed leiomyosarcoma of the spermatic cord. The patient is 
      on post-surgery follow-up and disease-free for six months. A literature review is 
      also presented.

AB  - Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is one of the useful procedures for the 
      investigation of thyroid swellings. FNAC is a minimally invasive procedure, is 
      cost effective, and a gold standard for diagnosing thyroid lesions. Haemorrhage, 
      thrombosis, and infarction are known common complications of FNAC. Post FNAC 
      infarction in thyroid gland has been known as a rare phenomenon. Here, we report 
      the case of a young female who underwent FNAC that showed Hurthle cell neoplasm 
      (Bethesda 3). Four weeks later, she underwent right thyroid lobectomy and the 
      final histology showed extensive necrosis and haemorrhage which is a diagnostic 
      dilemma and hampered our diagnosis.

AB  - Radiobasilic transposition arteriovenous fistula (RBTAVF) is often ignored as an 
      option for haemodialysis access. We present the case of a 57-year-old male 
      patient who presented at the AKUH vascular clinic, Karachi, for the creation of 
      long-term haemodialysis vascular access. He had small-sized forearm cephalic vein 
      (1.5 mm), but reasonable sized basilic vein. He underwent successful RBTAVF. Most 
      of the guidelines recommend brachiocephalic fistula (BCF) as the second choice 
      following radiocephalic AVF. This case recommends the inclusion of RBAVF as the 
      second choice for vascular access in international guidelines, in addition to BCF 
      and BBF.

LID - 10.47391/JPMA.4793 [doi]
AB  - Covid-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is a new entity and is 
      associated with high morbidity and mortality. Covid-19 is a pro-inflammatory and 
      immunosuppressive disease, provoking fungal infections, especially by Aspergillus 
      species. We describe the case of a critically ill Covid-19 female patient, who 
      was diagnosed with CAPA infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
      She was given intravenous Remdesivir. Her chest X-ray a few days after admission 
      showed multiple cavities. Her condition initially improved but deteriorated 
      again, with worsening hypoxia and pneumothorax and multiple cavitary lesions on 
      HRCT of the chest. Despite optimal treatment, she could not recover. 
      Interestingly, she had no predisposing risk factor for pulmonary aspergillosis, 
      such as chronic lung disease, diabetes or use of immunosuppressants such as 
      Tocilizumab. CAPA is an emerging entity with worsening hypoxia, and failure to 
      improve can be an early sign. Early identification and treatment can improve 
      survival and outcomes in Covid-19 patients.

      with pain in the neck, odynophagia, and intermittent fever after recovering from 
      Covid-19 a few weeks back. She had no significant history of past medical or 
      endocrine disease. TFTs revealed high T3 and T4 and low TSH. Thyroid scan 
      revealed decrease uptake and ESR was 115. She was started on NSAID, steroids, and 
      beta blocker. Four weeks later, she reverted with the resolution of symptoms and 
      normal TFTs.

      complicated cases can be surgical as well as conservative. We present two cases 
      of complicated jejunal diverticulosis that presented with acute abdomen and were 
      managed surgically. Post-operative recovery was satisfactory. Jejunal diverticula 
      is a diagnostic challenge in a low-resource peripheral hospital.

AB  - Ductal ectasia with metaplasia and focal epithelial proliferation in the oral 
      cavity does not correspond to any existing salivary gland lesion. A 72-year-old 
      man presented with a mass in the buccal mucosa, which was excised and initially 
      diagnosed as a cystadenoma. An upper lip mass on the right side, which developed 
      later, was also excised. The lesions were histologically similar, and since they 
      were multifocal and in non-contiguous and independent sites with multiple dilated 
      cystic structures that did not destroy the lobar architecture, the final 
      diagnosis was confirmed as ductal ectasia with metaplasia and focal epithelial 
      proliferation. This condition may mimic various neoplastic lesions.

TI  - The diabetic lung.
PG  - 191-192
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.03-23 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic drew our attention to the 
      interplay between pulmonary health and diabetes. The impact of poorly controlled 
      diabetes in worsening COVID-19 outcome is well-recognized. This article explores 
      the broad spectrum of associations between the lung and diabetes. The lung can be 
      the target of organ damage in diabetes, be the origin of a disease process 
      affecting glycaemic status, and also contribute to metabolic complications. 
      Diabetes can be a part of several pulmonary syndromes. Medications used for 
      diabetes can adversely affect the lungs and vice versa. On the other hand, 
      certain glucose-lowering drugs have the potential to improve respiratory 
      function. The close link between diabetes and lung disease calls for a combined 
      approach to managing these conditions.

PG  - 193-194
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.04-23 [doi]
AB  - Psychological insulin resistance is a well known entity. This communication 
      proposes the term 'insulin hesitancy' to describe the hesitation that a person 
      living with diabetes experiences, when advised to take insulin. It approaches 
      hesitancy through a triage model, based upon the language used by the patient. By 
      identifying the predominant adverb, "will not", "shall not", or "cannot" in the 
      patient's speech, the diabetes care professional can assess the degree of insulin 
      hesitancy, and tailor his or her conversation towards overcoming it.

TI  - Refractory and Resistant obesity: Dynamic Concepts, Contemporary Definitions.
PG  - 195-198
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.05-23 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a chronic disease requiring a multi-disciplinary approach for its 
      management. Despite multiple evolving and potent therapeutic options like 
      GLP-1RA's and bariatric surgery, some patients do not achieve significant weight 
      loss or expected metabolic outcomes. This manuscript highlights the concept of 
      resistant and refractory obesity and provides an operational framework to assess 
      adequacy of therapy, to rule out non-adherence, and to screen for non-adiposity 
      related and iatrogenic causes of weight gain. This would help clinicians to 
      assess clinical outcomes and plan management protocols in their clinical 
      practice. Furthermore, a clear understanding of these concepts would streamline 
      research in this area and facilitate policy making.

PG  - 199-201
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.06-23 [doi]
AB  - Up to 88% of patients with low grade glioma (LGG) experience seizures during the 
      course of their disease. In patients who undergo surgery for supratentorial low 
      grade glioma (SLGG), post-operative seizures can impact their quality of life and 
      complicate the post-operative management course. Evidence suggests that epileptic 
      activity can be related to tumour progression. In addition to the extent of 
      resection, recent studies have investigated the possible patient and tumour 
      factors which can influence post-operative seizure control in patients with SLGG.

AB  - 68Ga-DOTA NOC PET-CT imaging has been shown to have high accuracy for the 
      evaluation of neuroendocrine tumours. We report a case of a 3-year-old boy who 
      presented with a right paravertebral soft tissue mass. Biopsy showed 
      ganglioneuroblastoma. The patient was referred for 68Ga-DOTA NOC for staging. 
      68Ga-DOTA NOC PET/CT images showed somatostatin-avid large right paravertebral 
      soft tissue mass representing the primary lesion, along with increased 
      radiotracer localization at multiple metastatic lytic bone lesions in the axial 
      and appendicular skeleton. 68Ga-DOTA NOC PET-CT is helpful in the evaluation of 
      the disease extent of neuroendocrine tumours including ganglioneuroblastoma.

TI  - An overview of biofeedback techniques in mechanical low back pain: effects on 
      sensory integration of balance.
PG  - 204-206
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.08-23 [doi]
AB  - Low back pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder involving the lumbar spine. It 
      affects almost 80% of the world's population and is associated with functional 
      limitations. The reported global prevalence ranges from15-30%. Postural control 
      involves processing the information from sensory stimulus derivative of 
      vestibular, visual, and somatosensory systems in a coordinated manner to 
      precisely regulate center of mass and body positioning. Failure of one or more of 
      these systems, or incorrect processing of sensory information leads to 
      instability or risk of fall. Low back pain can also modify the sensory input for 
      postural control. Biofeedback can be utilized to assist "down-train" elevated 
      muscle activity or to "up-train" weak or inhibited, muscles. Clinicians can use 
      biofeedback to determine if patients are able to relax and evaluate 
      psychophysiological reactions of muscles. Using biofeedback, patients can be 
      educated about physiological processes and how biopsychosocial factors can 
      interact causing recurrent complaints of pain.

TI  - Hepatitis-associated aplastic anaemia: surveillance of 
      frequency,clinico-haematological features, and demographic distribution at a 
      tertiary care hospital in Pakistan.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to document the frequency of HAAA cases among AA patients 
      presenting at a tertiary care hospital, and to determine the most common agents 
      (viral/drug induced) and Clinico-haematological features among HAAA patients at a 
      tertiary care hospital. METHODS: This study was a retrospective review, conducted 
      at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients 
      were included in the study. Hepatitis among the HAAA patients was viral in 17 
      cases, while 4 were idiopathic. All the patients acquired aplastic anaemia within 
      3-12 months of the Hepatitis episode and most presented with bleeding, bruises 
      and petechiae. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates and proves that presence and 
      prevalence of this disease in the Pakistani population is quite significant. 
      Unlike the rest of the world, HAAA in Pakistan is not entirely of unknown 
      aetiology, most of the cases can be associated with one of the Hepatitis viruses.

TI  - Evaluation of data analytics workshop using RStudio amongst medical students in 
      Pakistan.
PG  - 222-224
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.6450 [doi]
AB  - A quasi-experimental study was conducted at the Aga Khan University, Karachi, 
      Pakistan, to evaluate the outcomes of a series of workshops on 25 medical 
      students' statistical knowledge and acceptance of RStudio. The knowledge in each 
      of the five sessions was assessed using pre- and post- knowledge-based quizzes. 
      In addition, the Student's Attitude Towards Statistics (SATS-36) and the 
      Technology Acceptance Model were used. Data analysis on RStudio revealed a 
      statistically significant improvement in knowledge in all five sessions (p<0.05). 
      SATS-36 showed statistically significant improvement in Cognitive Competence 
      (p<0.001). RStudio had commendable acceptance with relatively high scores of 
      Attitudes (behavioural intention, median = 6.00 [5.20-7.00]) and Utility 
      (perceived usefulness, median = 5.20 [4.10-6.20]). In conclusion, medical 
      students had improved statistical knowledge and acceptance towards the novel 
      statistical tool. Hence, further studies must evaluate the effectiveness of 
      RStudio when integrated as part of the medical curriculum.

TI  - An n-type All-Fused-Ring Molecule with Photoresponse to 1000 nm for Highly 
      Sensitive Near Infrared Photodetector.
PG  - e2211714
LID - 10.1002/adma.202211714 [doi]
AB  - Most of all-fused-ring π-conjugated molecules have wide or medium bandgap and 
      show photo response in the visible range. In this work, we report an 
      all-fused-ring n-type molecule, which exhibits ultrasmall optical bandgap of 
      1.22 eV and strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption with onset absorption 
      wavelength of 1013 nm. The molecule consists of 14 aromatic rings and has 
      electron donor-acceptor (D-A) characteristic. It exhibits excellent n-type 
      property with low-lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels of -5.48 eV/-3.95 eV and high 
      electron mobility of 7.0 × 10(-4) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) . Most importantly, its thin 
      film exhibits a low trap density of 5.55 ×10(16) cm(-3) because of the fixed 
      molecular conformation and consequently low conformation disorder. As a result, 
      organic photodetector (OPD) based on the compound exhibits a remarkably low dark 
      current density (J(d) ) of 2.01 × 10(-10) A cm(-2) at 0 V. The device shows a 
      shot-noise-limited specific detectivity (D(sh) *) of exceeding 10(13) Jones at 
      400-1000 nm wavelength region with a peak specific detectivity of 4.65 × 10(13) 
      Jones at 880 nm. This performance is among the best reported for self-powered NIR 
      OPDs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Why rural-to-urban migrant workers in China continue working after age 60: A 
      qualitative analysis.
LID - gnad016 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/geront/gnad016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine why rural-to-urban migrant 
      workers in China remain in the workforce after age 60. RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted and transcribed. Interview 
      transcriptions were coded and analyzed by inductive content analysis. RESULTS: 
      Rural-to-urban migrant workers in China continue to work even after they reach 
      age 60 for reasons related to personal and family finances, as well as cognitive 
      motivational, sociocultural, and working condition factors. DISCUSSION AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: Findings from this study deepen our understanding of the specific 
      reasons why older rural-to-urban migrant workers in China continue working after 
      age 60. While these findings emphasize the need for improved welfare programs and 
      enhanced healthcare for older migrant workers, they also underscore the 
      importance of providing a healthy and safe work environment for older workers.

TI  - Management of long-COVID-19 patients with sleep disorders: practical advice to 
      general practitioners.
PG  - 2182704
LID - 10.1080/19932820.2023.2182704 [doi]
LID - 2182704
AB  - Given the high prevalence of sleep disorders (e.g. insomnia) among long-COVID-19 
      patients (LC19Ps), approaches to tackle these disorders should not only depend on 
      sleep specialists, but they should also involve general practitioners (GPs). 
      Indeed, according to the World Health Organization, GPs should be on the front 
      line in the management of LC19Ps. However, in real practice, little data with 
      regard to the management of LC19Ps are available for GPs, which represents an 
      embarrassing situation. Thus, the main aim of this correspondence was to provide 
      GPs with some advice related to the management of sleep disorders in LC19Ps. The 
      pieces advice presented in this correspondence are related to: i) Early and 
      accurate recognition of sleep disorders, ii) General recommendations to manage 
      sleep disorders in LC19Ps (e.g. encouraging vaccination against the virus); and 
      iii) Specific recommendations, such as improving sleep hygiene (patients' 
      behavior and diet), psychological or behavioral therapies (stimulus control 
      therapy, relaxation, sleep restriction), promising tools (heart coherence, 
      neurofeedback), and pharmacological treatment. The authors of this correspondence 
      deeply believe that given the undesirable side effects associated with the use of 
      hypnotics, the pharmacological approach must only be a "last resort". The authors 
      believe that an important percentage of pharmacological prescriptions could be 
      avoided if more focus is put on educating GPs to provide LC19Ps with more tools 
      to deal with sleep disorders. The pieces advice presented in this correspondence 
      are indispensable to resume the normal life of LC19Ps and to promote their mental 
      health recovery.

TI  - A Brief Report on Living Arrangements Following Gray Divorce.
LID - gbad035 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/geronb/gbad035 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We offer new insights on how older adults in the U.S. navigate the 
      aftermath of gray divorce (i.e., divorce that occurs among adults aged 50+) by 
      describing their living arrangements upon divorce and tracking the stability of 
      these configurations over time. Living arrangements are important to decipher 
      because they are linked to health, well-being, and longevity. METHODS: Using data 
      from the 1998-2014 Health and Retirement Study, we uncovered patterns of U.S. 
      older adult living arrangements upon divorce (N = 1,057), distinguishing among 
      those who lived alone, lived with others, and lived with a new partner. 
      Multinomial logistic regression models were estimated to assess how individual 
      characteristics (demographics, marital biography, economic resources, health, and 
      social ties) were associated with these configurations. Cumulative survival 
      probabilities gauged the relative stability of these three living arrangements. 
      RESULTS: About half of U.S. adults lived alone upon gray divorce, another 
      one-third lived with others, and the remaining 14% lived with a new partner. 
      Adults living with a new partner tended to exhibit the most advantaged 
      sociodemographic profiles whereas those living solo or with others were largely 
      comparable. More than 70% of adults experienced a subsequent living arrangement 
      transition if they lived with others upon divorce, versus just 50% of those 
      living alone and only 30% of those with a new partner. DISCUSSION: After divorce, 
      older adults reside in a range of living arrangements, some of which are more 
      stable than others. Future work should address whether and how these arrangements 
      and their durability are related to post-divorce adjustment.

AB  - Molecular imprinted colorimetric sensors can realize visual semi-quantitative 
      analysis without the use of any equipment. With the advantages of low cost, fast 
      response, ease of handling, and excellent recognition ability, the molecular 
      imprinted colorimetric sensor shows great application potential in the field of 
      sample rapid assay. Molecular imprinted colorimetric sensors can be prepared in 
      various forms to meet the needs of different sample determination, such as film, 
      hydrogel, strip, and adsorption coating. In this review, the preparation methods 
      for various types of molecularly imprinted colorimetric sensors are 
      systematically introduced. Their applications in the field of on-site biological 
      sample detection, drug detection, disease treatment, chiral substance detection 
      and separation, environmental analysis, and food safety detection are introduced. 
      The limitations encountered in the practical application are presented, and the 
      future development directions prospect.

TI  - Dually Crosslinked Copper-Poly (Tannic Acid) Nanoparticles with 
      Microenvironment-Responsiveness for Infected Wound Treatment.
PG  - e2203063
LID - 10.1002/adhm.202203063 [doi]
AB  - Reducing the burden of death due to wound infection is an urgent global public 
      health priority. Metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) receive widespread attention in 
      antimicrobial infections due to their facile synthesis process, excellent 
      biocompatibility, and excellent antimicrobial properties brought about by 
      polyphenols and metal ions. However, typical therapeutic MPNs show rapid release 
      of metal ions due to their poor solution stability, impeding long-acting efficacy 
      in multiple wound healing stages. To address these issues, we prepared 
      copper-poly (tannic acid) nanoparticles (Cu-PTA NPs): robust (dually 
      crosslinked), microenvironment-responsive, antibacterial, antioxidative and 
      anti-inflammatory, which hierarchically modulate the infected wound healing 
      process. Covalently polymerized via phenol-formaldehyde condensation and 
      crosslinked with bioactive Cu(2+) , reactive polyphenols are preserved, and 
      Cu(2+) are efficiently entrapped in the PTA scaffold. The proposed strategy 
      relieves the systemic toxicity and only high ROS level as stimuli could "turn on" 
      the catalytic activity of Cu(2+) to implement antibacterial therapy specifically 
      in infected wound. Systematic tissue regeneration assessment on the infected 
      full-thickness skin wounds of rats demonstrates enhanced wound healing rate. 
      Cu-PTA NPs enables the direct application in infected wound and exertion of 
      long-acting healing efficacy. This synergetic therapy strategies will further 
      pave the way for more complicated infections and inflammatory diseases. This

TI  - Feasibility of the Palliative Care Education in Assisted Living Intervention for 
      Dementia Care Providers: A Cluster Randomized Trial.
LID - gnad018 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/geront/gnad018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease or related dementia are a major 
      cause of death in the United States. While effective interventions have been 
      developed to deliver palliative care to nursing home residents with ADRD, little 
      work has identified effective interventions to reach assisted living (AL) 
      residents with dementia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 118 AL residents with 
      dementia from 10 different ALs in Florida participated. A pilot study using a 
      cluster-randomized trial was conducted, with six sites randomized to receive a 
      palliative care educational intervention for staff (N =23) to deliver care to 
      residents; four sites were usual care. The feasibility of the intervention was 
      assessed by examining recruitment, retention and treatment fidelity at 6 months. 
      Cohen's d statistic was used to calculate facility level treatment effect sizes 
      on key outcomes (documentation of advance care planning discussions, hospice 
      admission, and documentation of pain screening). RESULTS: The intervention proved 
      feasible with high ratings of treatment fidelity. The intervention also 
      demonstrated preliminary evidence for efficacy of the intervention, with effect 
      sizes for the treatment group over .80 for increases in documentation of ACP 
      discussions compared to the control group. Hospice admissions had a smaller 
      effect size (.16) and documentation of pain screenings had no effect. DISCUSSION 
      AND IMPLICATIONS: The pilot results suggest that the intervention shows promise 
      as a resource for educating and empowering AL staff on implementing 
      person-centered palliative care delivery to persons with dementia in assisted 
      living. a larger, fully powered randomized trial Is needed to test for its 
      efficacy.

TI  - Preparing for the Future While Living in the Present: Older Adults' Experiences 
      Creating a Legacy of Values.
LID - gnad019 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/geront/gnad019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A legacy of values (e.g., legacy letter) is a 
      non-legal way to intentionally communicate intangible assets (e.g., values, life 
      lessons, and emotional and supportive instruction) with others. There is scant 
      research on legacy creation outside of a palliative care context, and no studies 
      have explored the experiences of community-dwelling older adults creating a 
      legacy of values. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: As part of an exploratory 
      sequential mixed methods study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 
      older adults (N=16) who had previously created a legacy of values. We analyzed 
      transcribed interviews using an interpretive descriptive approach. We iteratively 
      coded interviews deductively with sensitizing concepts identified in the 
      literature (existential well-being, end-of-life preparation and completion, 
      generativity, and resilience), and inductively, based on participants' 
      descriptions. Codes were categorized by patterns of motivations, content, 
      outcomes, and meaning, and thematically summarized. RESULTS: We conceptualized 
      the overall experience of creating a legacy of values as Preparing for the Future 
      While Living in the Present and identified four themes: Preserving the Intangible 
      for You and for Me, Sharing What I Want You to Know, Obtaining Peace through 
      Reflection and Preparation, and Living into a Continuing Legacy. Participants 
      attained peace, realized their life was not complete, and were challenged to live 
      intentionally through legacy creation. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Creating a 
      legacy of values may concurrently prepare older adults for the end of life and 
      the remainder of life. These findings offer insight into a generative act which 
      can promote intentional living among older adults.

TI  - Inequities in Mental Health Care facing Racialized Immigrant Older Adults with 
      Mental Disorders despite Universal Coverage: A Population-based Study in Canada.
LID - gbad036 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/geronb/gbad036 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Contemporary immigration scholarship has typically treated immigrants 
      with diverse racial backgrounds as a monolithic population. Knowledge gaps remain 
      in understanding how racial and nativity inequities in mental health care 
      intersect and unfold in midlife and old age. This study aims to examine the joint 
      impact of race, migration, and old age in shaping mental health treatment. 
      METHODS: Pooled data were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey 
      (2015-2018) and restricted to respondents (aged ≥ 45 years) with mood or anxiety 
      disorders (n=9,099). We employed multivariable logistic regression to estimate 
      associations between race-migration nexus and past-year mental health 
      consultations (MHC). We used Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis 
      to identify intersecting determinants of MHC. RESULTS: Compared to Canadian-born 
      Whites, racialized immigrants had greater mental health needs: poor/fair SRMH 
      (OR=2.23, 99% CI: 1.67 - 2.99), perceived life stressful (OR=1.49, 99% CI: 1.14 - 
      1.95), psychiatric comorbidity (OR=1.42, 99%CI: 1.06 - 1.89) and unmet needs for 
      care (OR=2.02, 99% CI: 1.36 - 3.02); in sharp contrast, they were less likely to 
      access mental health services across most indicators: overall past-year MHC 
      (OR=0.54, 99% CI: 0.41 - 0.71) and consultations with family doctors (OR=0.67, 
      99% CI: 0.50 - 0.89), psychologists (OR=0.67, 99% CI: 0.50 - 0.89), and social 
      workers (OR=0.67, 99% CI: 0.50 - 0.89), with the exception of psychiatrist visits 
      (p=0.324). The CART algorithm identifies three groups at risk of MHC service 
      underuse: racialized immigrants aged ≥ 55 years; immigrants without high school 
      diplomas; and linguistic minorities who were home renters. DISCUSSION: To 
      safeguard health care equity for medically underserved communities in Canada, 
      multisectoral efforts need to guarantee culturally responsive mental health care, 
      multilingual services, and affordable housing for racialized immigrant older 
      adults with mental disorders.

TI  - Defining the Surface Oxygen Threshold That Switches the Interaction Mode of 
      Graphene Oxide with Bacteria.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c10961 [doi]
AB  - As antimicrobials, graphene materials (GMs) may have advantages over traditional 
      antibiotics due to their physical mechanisms of action which ensure less chance 
      of development of microbial resistance. However, the fundamental question as to 
      whether the antibacterial mechanism of GMs originates from parallel interaction 
      or perpendicular interaction, or from a combination of these, remains poorly 
      understood. Here, we show both experimentally and theoretically that GMs with 
      high surface oxygen content (SOC) predominantly attach in parallel to the 
      bacterial cell surface when in the suspension phase. The interaction mode shifts 
      to perpendicular interaction when the SOC reaches a threshold of ∼0.3 (the atomic 
      percent of O in the total atoms). Such distinct interaction modes are highly 
      related to the rigidity of GMs. Graphene oxide (GO) with high SOC is very 
      flexible and thus can wrap bacteria while reduced GO (rGO) with lower SOC has 
      higher rigidity and tends to contact bacteria with their edges. Neither mode 
      necessarily kills bacteria. Rather, bactericidal activity depends on the 
      interaction of GMs with surrounding biomolecules. These findings suggest that 
      variation of SOC of GMs is a key factor driving the interaction mode with 
      bacteria, thus helping to understand the different possible physical mechanisms 
      leading to their antibacterial activity.

PG  - 8-14
LID - 10.14341/probl13140 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic Cushing's syndrome is a pathological condition characterized by 
      alternating periods of excessive cortisol secretion with corresponding clinical 
      manifestations and periods of spontaneous remission of the disease.To diagnose 
      Cyclic Cushing's syndrome it is necessary to record at least three episodes of 
      excessive cortisol secretion alternating with periods of normalization of its 
      production.In most cases, this pathology is diagnosed in patients with 
      ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor, however, there are rare cases of cyclic 
      hypercorticism with ectopic ACTH secretion by tumors of different localization 
      and without verification of pathological hormonal secretion focus. In addition, 
      cyclic hyperproduction of cortisol can be also observed in ACTH-independent 
      Cushing's syndrome associated with the presence of corticosteroma or adrenal 
      hyperplasia. The exact causes and mechanisms of the cyclic hypercorticism are 
      currently insufficiently studied.Due to the atypical course of the disease, the 
      unpredictability of the occurrence of a new «cycle», the variability of its 
      duration and manifestations (not only in different patients, but also in the same 
      patient), verification of the diagnosis and determination of treatment tactics 
      may be difficult in the daily practice of specialists, and the prevalence of this 
      condition can be undervalued.

AB  - Parathyroid cancer (PTC) is usually sporadic; however, it could be presented as a 
      component of hereditary syndromes. The prevalence of PTC among patients with 
      primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is about 1% cases. The lack of reliable 
      preoperative predictors significantly complicates the diagnosis of PTC. The 
      clinical course is non-specific and in most cases is determined by severe 
      hypercalcemia. The final diagnosis can only be made on the basis of invasive 
      histopathologic features, while an analysis immunohistochemical (IHC) one can be 
      used only as an additional method. Given the rarity the diagnosis of MEN1-related 
      PTC a challenge. We present two clinical cases of patients with PTC and a 
      verified heterozygous mutation in the MEN1 gene. The described cases demonstrate 
      the complexity of morphological diagnosis for PTC, the heterogeneity of clinical 
      manifestations in patients with the MEN1 mutation, as well as the need for timely 
      screening to identify other components of MEN1 syndrome and mutations of the MEN1 
      gene among first-line relatives.

      infarction: safety and impact on glycemic control].
PG  - 28-35
LID - 10.14341/probl13170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with diabetes type 2 (T2DM) 
      occurs 1.5-3.0 times higher than in general population. Metformin is 
      contraindicated for patients with T2DM and acute coronary syndrome due to the 
      risk of developing lactic acidosis. Using metformin more than 48 hours of MI is a 
      topical question, which will help to improve patient's safety. AIM: To evaluate 
      the safety and quality of glycemic control using metformin in patients with T2DM 
      during inpatient treatment for MIMATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 161 
      patients with T2DM, who were hospitalized consecutively with acute MI with 
      ST-elevation and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Average time 
      of metformin initiation was 5th day from admission. Creatinine was assessed at 
      admission and 48 hours after PCI. The acid-base balance and lactate were assessed 
      at admission and on the 3rd day after the start of using metformin. Criteria for 
      the effectiveness of glycemic control was the proportion of glycemic measurements 
      in target range of 6.1-10.0 mmol/l during hospitalization ("hospital time in 
      range", hTIR). hTIR >55% was considered to be a critical level. The long-term 
      outcome was estimated at 365 days after hospitalization. RESULTS: Metformin was 
      prescribed to 99 patients (61%) ("M+"group) during the hospitalization, 62 
      patients were in "M-"group. Use of metformin was accompanied with better glycemic 
      control in the «M+» group compared to the «M-»: mean glycemia 9.3 ± 1.6 vs 10.3 ± 
      2.3 mmol/l (p=0,002), SD 2.87 ± 1.1 vs 3.26 ± 1.8 (p=0,049), hTIR 60 ± 18% vs 48 
      ± 23% (p<0,001). There were clinically insignificant changes in acid-base balance 
      on the 3rd day from the start of metformin use in the "M+" group, the lactate 
      level did not increase. Use of metformin before to hospitalization with MI was 
      not associated with an increased risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI): RR 
      0.85 (0.37-1.96), p=0,691. CONCLUSION: Use of metformin in patients with T2DM and 
      acute MI is associated with better glycemic control. Carrying out angiography in 
      patients, treated with metformin before the hospitalization, is not accompanied 
      by an increased risk of developing AKI. Appointment of metformin in 3-7 days 
      after angiography does not lead to an increase level of lactate and significant 
      deviations in acid-base balance.

      registries].
PG  - 36-49
LID - 10.14341/probl13175 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies indicate a high incidence of various disorders of 
      carbohydrate metabolism against the new coronavirus infection. These disorders 
      aggravate the course of infection and increase mortality. Thereby, analysis of 
      risk factors for unfavorable outcomes and assessment of the long-term 
      consequences of COVID-19 in patients with impaired carbohydrate metabolism is of 
      great importance. AIM: To investigate the association between carbohydrate 
      metabolism disorders in COVID-19 patients and mortality, course of infection, 
      long-term consequences, as well as to identify risk factors for an unfavorable 
      disease course. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data from the 
      combined multicenter non-interventional real-world AKTIV and AKTIV 2 registries 
      was performed. The sample included 9290 patients who had COVID-19 with varying 
      severity from June 29, 2020, to November 29, 2020 (AKTIV) and from October 01, 
      2020, to March 30, 2021 (AKTIV 2). The patients were divided into 3 groups: Group 
      1 - patients with intact carbohydrate metabolism, n=6606; Group 2 - patients with 
      newly diagnosed hyperglycemia (NDH), n=1073; Group 3 - patients with a history of 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), n=1611. The groups were assessed for clinical and 
      laboratory parameters, comorbidities, mortality, carbohydrate metabolic status, 
      and well-being during the infection and at 12 months. RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      carbohydrate metabolism disorders (CMD) was 28,9%, with DM2 patients accounting 
      for 17,3% and patients with newly diagnosed hyperglycemia (NDH) for 11,6%. The 
      mortality rate of patients with hyperglycemia of any origin was 10.6%, which was 
      significantly higher compared to patients without hyperglycemia (3,9%). The 
      probability of lethal outcome increased 2,48-fold in the group of patients with 
      DM2 and 2,04-fold in the group of patients with NDH. At the same time, the 
      probability of a lethal outcome decreased 2,94-fold in patients without CMD. At 
      12 months, patients with CMD showed a significantly higher frequency and longer 
      persistence of complaints. This trend was more pronounced in patients with DM2 
      than in those with NDH. Only 1,7% of patients from the NDH group had type 2 
      diabetes and were receiving oral hypoglycemic medications one year after the 
      infection. A prognostic model was developed to determine the risk of lethal 
      outcome. The model included such known predictors as concomitant ischemic heart 
      disease, history of myocardial infarction or stroke, blood glucose level, and 
      age. CONCLUSION: Carbohydrate metabolism disorders aggravate the course of 
      COVID-19 and increase mortality. One year after infection, patients with DM2 and 
      NDH were more likely to have symptoms typical for post-COVID syndrome, and NDH 
      resolved in most cases after the infection.

LID - 10.14341/probl13160 [doi]
AB  - Glucocorticoid therapy is widely used in the treatment of various pathologies. 
      Sensitivity to glucocorticoids  (GC) has a serious impact not only on the 
      effectiveness of their action, but also on the severity of side effects, the 
      formation of risk factors and the development  of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). 
      Variability of sensitivity to GC causes different phenotypes and severity of 
      metabolic disorders underlying  CVD. Among  them, one can distinguish  a decrease 
      in muscle mass and strength, obesity, glucose and lipid metabolism impairment, 
      and others. Glucocorticoids carry out their effects by binding to the 
      glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and therefore this is considered a critical point 
      in their action. This review presents data on the significance of the 
      glucocorticoid  receptor structure, examines the main single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNP) of the NR3C1 gene associated with hypersensitivity  or 
      relative resistance to glucocorticoids  in the context of metabolic disorders and 
      the development of CVD. The association of the four most studied SNP of the GR 
      gene with metabolic risks is described in detail: BclI (rs41423247), N363S 
      (rs56149945), ER22/23EK (rs6189/rs6190), GR-9ß (rs6198). Their determination can 
      contribute to clarifying the prognosis of both the effectiveness of GC and the 
      development of metabolic disorders, and subsequent early correction of CVD risk 
      factors.

LID - 10.14341/probl13141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gonadotropin therapy in boys with congenital isolated 
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism helps to increase testes volume and induce 
      spermatogenesis in comparison with testosterone therapy. However, difficulties 
      with dose titration, partial therapy success, absence of generally accepted 
      regimen protocols don't allow to use this therapy in order to induce puberty in 
      adolescents with Kallmann syndrome or normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. 
      AIM: To assess the effectiveness of combination hormonal replacement therapy via 
      human chorionic gonadotropin and recombinant follicle stimulation hormone in 
      adolescents with congenital isolated normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and 
      with Kallmann syndromeMATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an open single-center 
      prospective non-controlled study. Boys with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism were 
      receiving hormonal replacement therapy for 12 months. Initial dose of human 
      chorionic gonadotropin was 500 IU per week. Initial dose of recombinant follicle 
      stimulation hormone was 37.5 IU per week. Doses were doubled in 6 months. 
      Antropometric data, Tanner stage, testes volumes, inhibin B and anti-Mullerian 
      hormone (AMH) levels were evaluated in all the patients before the treatment, 
      after 6 and 12 months of the therapy. RESULTS: 8 boys with hypogonadotropic 
      hypogonadism were included into the study. Median age before therapy initiation 
      was 15.7 years [15.33; 16.41]. In 12 months after the therapy initiation puberty 
      development, testosterone increase from 0.44 [0.34;0.62] to 4.39 [0.88;10.51] 
      nmol/l (p=0.012), AMH decrease from 35.70 [18.00;59.00] to 14.41 [11.60;16.65] 
      ng/ml were noted in all the patients (p=0.017). Testes volumes increase and 
      inhibin B level increase were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: 
      Gonadotropin therapy is effective in order to puberty initiation in adolescents 
      with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In helps to achieve not only 
      androgenization, but also to Sertoli cells maturation.

PG  - 76-85
LID - 10.14341/probl13210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function mutations in the TSH receptor gene (TSHR) 
      (NP_000360.2) are the potential causes of thyroid dysgenesis in patients with 
      congenital hypothyroidism. Heterozygous variants of the TSHR gene lead to partial 
      resistance to TSH, homozygous and compound heterozygous variants have been shown 
      to cause CH due to thyroid hypoplasia or TSH resistance. Recently more and more 
      articles in this field have appeared in the international literature sources, 
      while local publications are limited. The studies are necessary to understand the 
      etiology, pathogenesis of the disease, to improve the management of these 
      patients. AIM: To assess the frequency of incidence of pathogenic variants of the 
      TSHR gene in children with CH due to thyroid dysgenesis. To study inheritance and 
      phenotypic patterns of CH in families. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 
      single-center interventional one-stage non-comparative study a group of CH 
      patients was examined. The patients underwent neck ultrasound and radionuclide 
      imaging. The examination was performed 14 days after hormone replacement therapy 
      suspension or prior to its initiation. The structure of thyroid dysgenesis was 
      estimated, genetic testing for mutations in the TSHR gene was performed using the 
      NGS method. RESULTS: The study included 95 children with primary CH (75 girls; 20 
      boys). The patients' median age at the time of examination was 6.2 years [4.5; 
      8.9], the median level of neonatal TSH was 157.5 mU/l [60.9; 257.2]. Ectopic 
      thyroid was found in 52% of children, aplasia in 36%, hypoplasia and hemiagenesis 
      in 10% and 2%, respectively. In 5.4% of cases (in 5 out of 95 patients), 
      different variants of the TSH gene were detected. Two children had heterozygous 
      p.R450H and p.D487N variants in TSHR gene, two patients was homozygous for the 
      p.S49Afs * 9 variant, one child had compound heterozygous variants (p.A485D and 
      p.R450H). According to ultrasound imaging, all patients had thyroid hypoplasia of 
      varying severity. Three children underwent thyroid scintigraphy, which revealed 
      decreased 99mТc pertechnetate uptake (0.3-0.9%). CONCLUSION: In our study, the 
      incidence of different variants in the TSHR gene in children with CH was 5.3%. 
      Our analysis uncovered two previously undescribed variants. Genetic testing may 
      be able to help with making the diagnosis, patient's management, and genetic 
      counseling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare life-threatening disease 
      characterised by persistent hypoglycaemia as a result of inappropriate insulin 
      secretion, which can lead to irreversible neurological defects in infants. AIM: 
      To evaluate neurophysiological characteristics of central nervous system in 
      children with congenital hyperinsulinism treated according to the international 
      protocol in Russian Federation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective, 
      prospective cohort study included 73 patients who received treatment for CHI 
      according to the current international protocol at different departments of the 
      Almazov National Medical Research Centre from 2017 to 2022. All patients 
      underwent a comprehensive examination, including electroencephalography (EEG). 
      RESULTS: Among 73 patients with CHI, 35% (23) had focal form of the disease, 65% 
      had non-focal form (49% (39) - diffuse form, 16% (11) - atypical form). All 
      patients with focal form of CHI had a recovery as an outcome.Analysing the EEG 
      data we found that paroxysmal activity was recorded in 23 patients (32%), 50 
      patients did not have paroxysmal activity (68%). Diffuse changes were observed in 
      47 patients (64%), whereas 26 patients (36%) were absent of it. By constructing 
      Kaplan-Meier curves we found that the alpha rhythm is formed significantly 
      (p=0.026) earlier in patients with a focal form of CHI. CONCLUSION: CHI patients 
      treated according to the international guidelines in Russian Federation show 
      rather positive neurological outcome. We established that alpha rhythm earliest 
      formation is associated with focal form of CHI.

PG  - 86-95
LID - 10.14341/probl13205 [doi]
AB  - The increasing of older age group in the population determines studying of age 
      related diseases and emergence of new investigations in this area. In Female 
      body, entering the menopausal transition is the start of «aging» of reproductive 
      function and linked with decreasing of sex hormons levels. A direct connection 
      between changes of estrogen, progesterone, androgen ratios and cognitive function 
      of women was revealed. The anatomical localization of sex hormone receptors, the 
      mechanisms of interaction of hormones with these receptors determine the ways of 
      implementing biological effects of steroids on the CNS. Modern theories of 
      «healthy nerve cells» and «eu-estrogenemia» explains the role of additional 
      criteria, such as the absence of neurological diseases history and the duration 
      of hypoestrogenia, to the outcome of menopausal hormone therapy. Additional 
      factors that can affect to MHT action include: the composition of hormone 
      therapy, administration methods, regimens (cyclic, continuous), duration of 
      treatment, history of endocrine diseases, diabetes mellitus, gynecological 
      history (parity, menarche age, COC use), heredity. The sections present the 
      effect of menopausal transition on the development of depression, mood changes, 
      sleep disturbances and mental disabilities. The explanation of negative effects 
      of menopausal hormone therapy to cognitive health is also described by modern 
      point of view. The ambivalent opinions of researchers, the potential of new 
      reading of the results of earlier studies, confirms the necessity of continuing 
      study of this topic.

TI  - Bend-insensitive fiber optic ultrasonic tracking probe for cardiovascular 
      interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is widely used to guide 
      medical device placement in minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures. 
      However, visualization of the device tip with TEE can be challenging. Ultrasonic 
      tracking, enabled by an integrated fiber optic ultrasound sensor (FOUS) that 
      receives transmissions from the TEE probe, is very well suited to improving 
      device localization in this context. The problem addressed in this study is that 
      tight deflections of devices such as a steerable guide catheter can result in 
      bending of the FOUS beyond its specifications and a corresponding loss of 
      ultrasound sensitivity. PURPOSE: A bend-insensitive FOUS was developed, and its 
      utility with ultrasonic tracking of a steerable tip during TEE-based image 
      guidance was demonstrated. METHODS: Fiberoptic ultrasound sensors were fabricated 
      using both standard and bend insensitive single mode fibers and subjected to 
      static bending at the distal end. The interference transfer function and 
      ultrasound sensitivities were compared for both types of FOUS. The 
      bend-insensitive FOUS was integrated within a steerable guide catheter, which 
      served as an exemplar device; the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of tracking signals 
      from the catheter tip with a straight and a fully deflected distal end were 
      measured in a cardiac ultrasound phantom for over 100 frames. RESULTS: With tight 
      bending at the distal end (bend radius < 10 mm), the standard FOUS experienced a 
      complete loss of US sensitivity due to high attenuation in the fiber, whereas the 
      bend-insensitive FOUS had largely unchanged performance, with a SNR of 47.7 for 
      straight fiber and a SNR of 36.8 at a bend radius of 3.0 mm. When integrated into 
      the steerable guide catheter, the mean SNRs of the ultrasonic tracking signals 
      recorded with the catheter in a cardiac phantom were similar for straight and 
      fully deflected distal ends: 195 and 163. CONCLUSION: The FOUS fabricated from 
      bend-insensitive fiber overcomes the bend restrictions associated with the FOUS 
      fabricated from standard single mode fiber, thereby enabling its use in 
      ultrasonic tracking in a wide range of cardiovascular devices.

AB  - Class IB phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Kγ) is activated in immune cells and can 
      form two distinct complexes (p110γ-p84 and p110γ-p101), which are differentially 
      activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and Ras. Using a combination of 
      X-ray crystallography, hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), 
      electron microscopy, molecular modeling, single-molecule imaging, and activity 
      assays, we identify molecular differences between p110γ-p84 and p110γ-p101 that 
      explain their differential membrane recruitment and activation by Ras and GPCRs. 
      The p110γ-p84 complex is dynamic compared with p110γ-p101. While p110γ-p101 is 
      robustly recruited by Gβγ subunits, p110γ-p84 is weakly recruited to membranes by 
      Gβγ subunits alone and requires recruitment by Ras to allow for Gβγ activation. 
      We mapped two distinct Gβγ interfaces on p101 and the p110γ helical domain, with 
      differences in the C-terminal domain of p84 and p101 conferring sensitivity of 
      p110γ-p101 to Gβγ activation. Overall, our work provides key insight into the 
      molecular basis for how PI3Kγ complexes are activated.

AB  - The lateral habenula (LHb) encodes aversive states, and its dysregulation is 
      implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. The 
      endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a neuromodulatory signaling system that broadly 
      serves to counteract the adverse effects of stress; however, CB(1) receptor 
      signaling within the LHb can paradoxically promote anxiogenic- and 
      depressive-like effects. Current reports of synaptic actions of eCBs in the LHb 
      are conflicting and lack systematic investigation of eCB regulation of excitatory 
      and inhibitory transmission. Here, we report that eCBs differentially regulate 
      glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission in the LHb, exhibiting canonical and 
      circuit-specific inhibition of both systems and an opposing potentiation of 
      synaptic glutamate release mediated via activation of CB(1) receptors on 
      astrocytes. Moreover, simultaneous depression of GABA and potentiation of 
      glutamate release increases the net excitation-inhibition ratio onto LHb neurons, 
      suggesting a potential cellular mechanism by which cannabinoids may promote LHb 
      activity and subsequent anxious- and depressive-like aversive states.

AB  - Sensory neurons in the neocortex exhibit distinct functional selectivity to 
      constitute the neural map. While neocortical map of the visual cortex in higher 
      mammals is clustered, it displays a striking "salt-and-pepper" pattern in 
      rodents. However, little is known about the origin and basis of the interspersed 
      neocortical map. Here we report that the intricate excitatory neuronal 
      kinship-dependent synaptic connectivity influences precise functional map 
      organization in the mouse primary visual cortex. While sister neurons originating 
      from the same neurogenic radial glial progenitors (RGPs) preferentially develop 
      synapses, cousin neurons derived from amplifying RGPs selectively antagonize 
      horizontal synapse formation. Accordantly, cousin neurons in similar layers 
      exhibit clear functional selectivity differences, contributing to a 
      salt-and-pepper architecture. Removal of clustered protocadherins (cPCDHs), the 
      largest subgroup of the diverse cadherin superfamily, eliminates functional 
      selectivity differences between cousin neurons and alters neocortical map 
      organization. These results suggest that developmental neuronal origin regulates 
      neocortical map formation via cPCDHs.

AB  - Signal-sequence-dependent protein targeting is essential for the spatiotemporal 
      organization of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and is facilitated by dedicated 
      protein targeting factors such as the signal recognition particle (SRP). However, 
      targeting signals are not exclusively contained within proteins but can also be 
      present within mRNAs. By in vivo and in vitro assays, we show that mRNA targeting 
      is controlled by the nucleotide content and by secondary structures within mRNAs. 
      mRNA binding to bacterial membranes occurs independently of soluble targeting 
      factors but is dependent on the SecYEG translocon and YidC. Importantly, membrane 
      insertion of proteins translated from membrane-bound mRNAs occurs independently 
      of the SRP pathway, while the latter is strictly required for proteins translated 
      from cytosolic mRNAs. In summary, our data indicate that mRNA targeting acts in 
      parallel to the canonical SRP-dependent protein targeting and serves as an 
      alternative strategy for safeguarding membrane protein insertion when the SRP 
      pathway is compromised.

AB  - Timely completion of genome replication is a prerequisite for mitosis, genome 
      integrity, and cell survival. A challenge to this timely completion comes from 
      the need to replicate the hundreds of untranscribed copies of rDNA that organisms 
      maintain in addition to the copies required for ribosome biogenesis. Replication 
      of these rDNA arrays is relegated to late S phase despite their large size, 
      repetitive nature, and essentiality. Here, we show that, in Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae, reducing the number of rDNA repeats leads to early rDNA replication, 
      which results in delaying replication elsewhere in the genome. Moreover, cells 
      with early-replicating rDNA arrays and delayed genome-wide replication aberrantly 
      release the mitotic phosphatase Cdc14 from the nucleolus and enter anaphase 
      prematurely. We propose that rDNA copy number determines the replication time of 
      the rDNA locus and that the release of Cdc14 upon completion of rDNA replication 
      is a signal for cell cycle progression.

AB  - Monocytes can differentiate into macrophages (Mo-Macs) or dendritic cells 
      (Mo-DCs). The cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 
      induces the differentiation of monocytes into Mo-Macs, while the combination of 
      GM-CSF/interleukin (IL)-4 is widely used to generate Mo-DCs for clinical 
      applications and to study human DC biology. Here, we report that pharmacological 
      inhibition of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
      gamma (PPARγ) in the presence of GM-CSF and the absence of IL-4 induces monocyte 
      differentiation into Mo-DCs. Remarkably, we find that simultaneous inhibition of 
      PPARγ and the nutrient sensor mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) 
      induces the differentiation of Mo-DCs with stronger phenotypic stability, 
      superior immunogenicity, and a transcriptional profile characterized by a strong 
      type I interferon (IFN) signature, a lower expression of a large set of 
      tolerogenic genes, and the differential expression of several transcription 
      factors compared with GM-CSF/IL-4 Mo-DCs. Our findings uncover a pathway that 
      tailors Mo-DC differentiation with potential implications in the fields of DC 
      vaccination and cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Senescence-associated exosomes transfer miRNA-induced fibrosis to neighboring 
      cells.
LID - 10.18632/aging.204539 [doi]
AB  - Radiation-induced fibrosis is a common side effect of radiotherapy, which is the 
      most common treatment for cancer. However, radiation also causes p53-mediated 
      cell cycle arrest, prolonged expression of p21, and the development of senescence 
      in normal cells that reside in irradiated tissues. Bone marrow-derived 
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) accumulate in primary tumor sites because of their 
      natural tropism for inflammatory and fibrotic tissues. MSCs are extremely 
      sensitive to low doses of ionizing radiation and acquire senescence as a result 
      of bystander radiation effects. Senescent cells remain metabolically active but 
      develop a potent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that correlates 
      to hyperactive secretion of cytokines, pro-fibrotic growth factors, and exosomes 
      (EXOs). Integrative pathway analysis highlighted that radiation-induced 
      senescence significantly enriched cell-cycle, extracellular matrix, transforming 
      growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling, and vesicle-mediated transport genes in MSCs. 
      EXOs are cell-secreted nanovesicles (a subclass of small extracellular vesicles) 
      that contain biomaterials-proteins, RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs)-that are critical in 
      cell-cell communication. miRNA content analysis of secreted EXOs further revealed 
      that radiation-induced senescence uniquely altered miRNA profiles. In fact, 
      several of the standout miRNAs directly targeted TGF-β or downstream genes. To 
      examine bystander effects of radiation-induced senescence, we further treated 
      normal MSCs with senescence-associated EXOs (SA-EXOs). These modulated genes 
      related to TGF-β pathway and elevated both alpha smooth muscle actin (protein 
      increased in senescent, activated cells) and Ki-67 (proliferative marker) 
      expression in SA-EXO treated MSCs compared to untreated MSCs. We revealed SA-EXOs 
      possess unique miRNA content that influence myofibroblast phenotypes via TGF-β 
      pathway activation. This highlights that SA-EXOs are potent SASP factors that 
      play a large role in cancer-related fibrosis.

TI  - Lipoamide dehydrogenase (LADH) deficiency: medical perspectives of the structural 
      and functional characterization of LADH and its pathogenic variants.
LID - 10.1007/s42977-023-00155-6 [doi]
AB  - (Dihydro)lipoamide dehydrogenase (LADH) deficiency is an autosomal recessive 
      genetic metabolic disorder. It generally presents with an onset in the neonatal 
      age and premature death. The clinical picture usually involves metabolic 
      decompensation and lactic acidosis that lead to neurological, cardiological, 
      and/or hepatological outcomes. Severity of the disease is due to the fact that 
      LADH is a common E3 subunit to the pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate, 
      alpha-ketoadipate, and branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes and 
      is also part of the glycine cleavage system; hence, a loss in LADH activity 
      adversely affects several central metabolic pathways simultaneously. The severe 
      clinical manifestations, however, often do not parallel the LADH activity loss, 
      which implies the existence of auxiliary pathological pathways; stimulated 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as dissociation from the 
      relevant multienzyme complexes proved to be auxiliary exacerbating 
      pathomechanisms for selected disease-causing LADH mutations. This review provides 
      an overview on the therapeutic challenges of inherited metabolic diseases, 
      structural and functional characteristics of the mitochondrial alpha-keto acid 
      dehydrogenase complexes, molecular pathogenesis and structural basis of LADH 
      deficiency, and relevant potential future medical perspectives.

TI  - Hemispheric asymmetries in mental disorders: evidence from rodent studies.
LID - 10.1007/s00702-023-02610-z [doi]
AB  - The brain is built with hemispheric asymmetries in structure and function to 
      enable fast neuronal processing. In neuroimaging studies, several mental 
      disorders have been associated with altered or attenuated hemispheric 
      asymmetries. However, the exact mechanism linking asymmetries and disorders is 
      not known. Here, studies in animal models of mental disorders render important 
      insights into the etiology and neuronal alterations associated with both 
      disorders and atypical asymmetry. In this review, the current literature of 
      animal studies in rats and mice focusing on anxiety and fear, anhedonia and 
      despair, addiction or substance misuse, neurodegenerative disorders as well as 
      stress exposure, and atypical hemispheric asymmetries is summarized. Results 
      indicate overall increased right-hemispheric neuronal activity and a left-sided 
      behavioral bias associated with symptoms of anxiety, fear, anhedonia, behavioral 
      despair as well as stress exposure. Addiction behavior is associated with 
      right-sided bias and transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease indicate an 
      asymmetrical accumulation of fibrillar plaques. Most studies focused on changes 
      in the bilateral amygdala and frontal cortex. Across studies, two crucial factors 
      influencing atypical asymmetries arose independently of the disorder modeled: sex 
      and developmental age. In conclusion, animal models of mental disorders 
      demonstrate atypical hemispheric asymmetries similar to findings in patients. 
      Particularly, increased left-sided behavior and greater right-hemispheric 
      activity were found across models applying stress-based paradigms. However, sex- 
      and age-dependent effects on atypical hemispheric asymmetries are present that 
      require further investigation. Animal models enable the analysis of hemispheric 
      changes on the molecular level which may be most effective to detect early 
      alterations.

TI  - Suffering and the dilemmas of pediatric care: a response to Tyler Tate.
LID - 10.1007/s11017-023-09615-5 [doi]
AB  - In a recent article, Tyler Tate argues that the suffering of 
      children - especially children with severe cognitive impairments - should be 
      regarded as the antithesis of flourishing, where flourishing is relative to one's 
      individual characteristics and essentially involves receiving care from others. 
      Although initially persuasive, Tate's theory is ambiguous in several ways, 
      leading to significant conceptual problems. By identifying flourishing with 
      receiving care, Tate raises questions about the importance of care that he does 
      not address, giving rise to a bootstrapping problem. By making flourishing 
      relative to an individual's circumstances, Tate is forced to confront questions 
      about exactly how relative it can be, suggesting the possibility that, on his 
      view, to flourish is simply to be however one is. In an attempt to surmount these 
      problems, I offer a revision and restatement of Tate's view that defines the 
      relationship between individualized flourishing and the more conventional, 
      species-relative concept, and describe more clearly the role that care should 
      play with respect to flourishing - one that is instrumental and not merely 
      constitutive. Even this restated view, however, fails to answer difficult 
      questions about how one should respond to the medical needs of some children, 
      highlighting the fact that a conceptual analysis of suffering may do little, in 
      the end, to untangle ethical dilemmas in the care of severely ill children.

TI  - Prevalence and Burden of Migraine in Switzerland: Cross-Sectional Study in ten 
      Specialised Headache Centres from the BECOME Study.
LID - 10.1007/s40122-023-00484-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is limited real-world evidence on the burden of migraine 
      among patients with prior preventive treatment failure (PPTF). In the BECOME 
      Swiss subanalysis, we aimed to assess current prevalence of PPTF in patients with 
      migraine seen at specialised headache centres in Switzerland and burden of 
      migraine in these patients. Furthermore, we assessed this burden in subgroups 
      stratified by monthly migraine days (MMDs) and number of PPTFs. METHODS: BECOME 
      was a prospective, multicentre, non-interventional two-part study conducted in 17 
      countries across Europe and Israel. This subanalysis includes patients visiting 
      ten headache specialist centres in Switzerland. In part 1, patients visiting the 
      centres over 3 months were screened by physicians for frequency of PPTF, MMD and 
      other migraine characteristics. Patients with ≥ 1 PPTF and ≥ 4 MMDs were invited 
      to take part in part 2. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients 
      with ≥ 1 PPTF (part 1). Other endpoints included proportion of patients specified 
      by number of PPTF and MMD (part 1, part 2), and impact of migraine on 
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs; part 2). RESULTS: Patients (1677) from ten Swiss 
      centres were included in part 1, of which 855 (51.0%) reported ≥ 1 PPTF. One 
      hundred fifty-five patients were included in part 2: 6.5% reported ≥ 4 PPTFs and 
      43.2% reported ≥ 15 MMDs. Mean EuroQoL 5 and EuroQoL visual analogue scale 
      (EQ-VAS) were 0.8 ± 0.2 and 69.6 ± 20.2, respectively, suggesting a mild level of 
      impairment in the daily functioning and self-reported health of the patients. 
      Mean six-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and modified Migraine Disability 
      Assessment (mMIDAS) scores were 63.3 ± 6.5 and 22.7 ± 21.8, respectively, 
      corresponding to severe migraine burden. Patients also reported impairment in 
      work-related productivity and general activities (48.6 ± 22.8) but no 
      associations of anxiety (7.2 ± 4.4) or depression (6.0 ± 4.4) with migraine were 
      noted. Burden of migraine increased with increasing frequency of PPTF and MMD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Migraine-related quality of life, as well as work productivity are 
      significantly affected in Swiss patients with migraine. Increasing migraine 
      burden is associated with increasing migraine frequency and prior treatment 
      failures.

TI  - Inflammation in the peripheral blood system of Crohn's Disease.
LID - 10.1007/s10238-023-01030-3 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease that is characterized by 
      chronic inflammation of digestive system and has a nickname "green cancer" 
      because of its sustained alternation of periods of flares and remissions. Here, 
      we investigated the inflammation changes in peripheral blood system of CD 
      patients, which are less reported in China. Peripheral blood samples of 167 CD 
      patients and 30 healthy people, as well as their clinical information, were 
      collected at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. Flow cytometry 
      was performed to analyze the ratio of CD4 T cells to CD8 T cells. Cytometric Bead 
      Array kit was used to detect the cytokines in peripheral blood in CD patients. 
      Moreover, the expression of inflammasomes was also detected by RT-PCR. The 
      percentage and cell number of lymphocytes in CD patients' peripheral blood system 
      decreased significantly, while monocytes increased remarkably. Interestingly, 
      there was an inversion of the CD4 T cells/CD8 T cells ratio in peripheral blood 
      of CD patients. The levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α 
      (TNF-α) increased significantly in CD patients' peripheral blood, and 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation aggravate inflammatory response. In 
      addition, the expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like 
      receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) and NLRP3 in peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CD patients increased significantly after LPS 
      stimulation. The inflammation in peripheral blood of CD patients had significant 
      changes, including PBMC, cytokines and inflammasomes. These results are helpful 
      to get a deeper understanding of CD and improve the efficiency of diagnosis and 
      treatment in China.

      cognitive function in aged mice.
PG  - 932-946
LID - 10.18632/aging.204554 [doi]
AB  - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a molecular sensor that plays a 
      critical role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. Dysregulation of the 
      AMPK signaling has been linked to synaptic failure and cognitive impairments. Our 
      recent study demonstrates abnormally increased AMPK activity in the hippocampus 
      of aged mice. The kinase catalytic subunit of AMPK exists in two isoforms α1 and 
      α2, and their specific roles in aging-related cognitive deficits are unknown. 
      Taking advantage of the unique transgenic mice (AMPKα1/α2 cKO) recently developed 
      by our group, we investigated how isoform-specific suppression of the neuronal 
      AMPKα may contribute to the regulation of cognitive and synaptic function 
      associated with aging. We found that aging-related impairment of long-term object 
      recognition memory was improved with suppression of AMPKα1 but not AMPKα2 
      isoform. Moreover, aging-related spatial memory deficits were unaltered with 
      suppression of either AMPKα isoform. Biochemical experiments showed that the 
      phosphorylation levels of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α subunit (eIF2α) 
      were specifically decreased in the hippocampus of the AMPKα1 cKO mice. We further 
      performed large-scale unbiased proteomics analysis and revealed identities of 
      proteins whose expression is differentially regulated with AMPKα isoform 
      suppression. These novel findings may provide insights into the roles of AMPK 
      signaling pathway in cognitive aging.

TI  - Allopregnanolone-mediated GABAA-Rα4 function in amygdala and hippocampus of PMDD 
      liver qi-invasion syndrome model rats.
PG  - 1143-1157
LID - 10.18632/aging.204541 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a common mental health 
      challenge among women of reproductive age. Allopregnanolone (3α, 5α-THP; ALLO) 
      mediated functional alterations of GABAA receptors (GABAA-R) are involved in PMDD 
      pathogenesis, however, the specific mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, we 
      investigated the role of ALLO mediated GABAA-Rα4 in the pathophysiology of PMDD. 
      PURPOSE: We determined whether the pathogenesis of PMDD is associated with ALLO 
      mediated GABAA-Rα4 expression changes in different brain regions. METHODS: Rat 
      models of PMDD liver-qi invasion syndrome (PMDD-LIS) were established via the 
      resident intruder paradigm. Behavioral changes of rats were assessed by 
      aggressive behavior tests, EPM and OFT. The levels of progesterone and ALLO in 
      serum as well as brain areas were determined by ELISA. Variations in GABAA-Rα4 
      levels in brain regions were assessed by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Medicated 
      serum was used to interfere with rat hippocampal neurons, and changes in Cl(-) 
      current were recorded through electrophysiology. RESULTS: Premenstrual anxiety 
      and irritability of PMDD-LIS patients can be simulated in PMDD-LIS rat models. 
      Exogenous ALLO significantly improved the anxiety behaviors of PMDD-LIS rats. 
      Changes in ALLO among different brain regions varied. GABAA-Rα4 expressions were 
      low in the amygdala and abnormally high in the hippocampus, however, ALLO 
      alleviated these deviations. Whole-cell patch clamp recording technique showed a 
      weaker Cl(-) current intensity of PMDD-LIS rats, reduced neuroinhibitory 
      functions and increased Cl(-) current intensity in the ALLO group drug serum 
      intervention and enhanced emotional inhibition function. CONCLUSION: We 
      established that ALLO regulation of the GABAA-Rα4 subunit in the amygdala and 
      hippocampus is involved in PMDD-LIS pathogenesis.

TI  - Comparing survival outcomes between neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy within 
      breast cancer subtypes and stages among older women: a SEER-Medicare analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s12282-023-01441-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare survival outcomes of neoadjuvant (NAC) 
      and adjuvant chemotherapy (AdC) within each breast cancer subtype and stage among 
      older women. METHODS: Older (≥ 66 years) women newly diagnosed with stage I-III 
      invasive ductal breast cancer during 2010-2017 and treated with both chemotherapy 
      and surgery within one year were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
      and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Analyses were performed within each of 
      six groups, jointly defined based on subtype (hormone receptor 
      [HR]-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative, HER2 + , 
      and triple-negative) and stage (I-II and III). Kaplan-Meier curves and 
      multivariable Cox models were used to compare overall and recurrence-free 
      survival between NAC and AdC, with optimal full matching performed for 
      confounding adjustment. RESULTS: Among 8,495 included patients, 8,329 (20.6% 
      received NAC) remained after matching. Before multiple testing adjustment, Cox 
      models showed that NAC was associated with a lower hazard for death among stage 
      III HER2 + patients (hazard ratio = 0.347, 95% confidence interval CI 
      0.161-0.745) but a higher hazard for death among triple-negative patients (stage 
      I-II: hazard ratio = 1.558, 95% CI 1.024-2.370; stage III: hazard ratio = 2.453; 
      95% CI 1.254-4.797). A higher hazard for death/recurrence was associated with NAC 
      among stage I-II HR + /HER2- patients (hazard ratio = 1.305, 95% CI 1.007-1.693). 
      No significant difference remained after multiple testing adjustment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The opposite trends (before multiple testing adjustment) of survival 
      comparisons for advanced HER2 + and triple-negative disease warrant further 
      research. Caution is needed due to study limitations such as cancer stage 
      validity.

TI  - Prevalence of genotoxic bacteria in men undergoing biopsy for prostate cancer.
LID - 10.1002/pros.24500 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New evidence suggests that bacteria-produced DNA toxins may have a 
      role in the development or progression of prostate cancer. To determine the 
      prevalence of these genes in a noninfection (i.e., colonized) state, we screened 
      urine specimens in men before undergoing a biopsy for prostate cancer detection. 
      METHODS: We developed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction using three of the 
      most described bacterial genotoxin gene primers: Colibactin (polyketone 
      synthase [pks] gene island: clbN and clbB), cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf1) 
      toxin, and cytolethal distending toxin B (cdtB) represented gene islands. After 
      calibration on Escherichia coli samples of known genotypes, we used a training 
      and validation cohort. We performed multiplex testing on a training cohort of 
      previously collected urine from 45 men undergoing prostate biopsy. For the 
      validation cohort, we utilized baseline urine samples from a previous randomized 
      clinical trial (n = 263) with known prostate cancer outcomes. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of four common bacterial genotoxin genes detected in the urine before 
      prostate biopsy for prostate cancer is 8% (25/311). The prevalence of pks island 
      (clbN and clbB), cnf1, and cdt toxin genes are 6.1%, 2.4%, and 1.7%, 
      respectively. We found no association between urinary genotoxins and prostate 
      cancer (p = 0.83). We did identify a higher proportion of low-grade cancer (92% 
      vs. 44%) in those men positive for urinary genotoxin and higher-grade cancer in 
      those genotoxin negative (8% vs. 56%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of 
      urinary genotoxins is low and does not correspond to a prostate cancer diagnosis. 
      The urine was taken at one point in time and does not rule out the possibility of 
      previous exposure.

AB  - Many motile bacteria employ the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) to 
      build the flagellum on the cell surface. The fT3SS consists of a transmembrane 
      export gate complex, which acts as a proton/protein antiporter that couples 
      proton flow with flagellar protein export, and a cytoplasmic ATPase ring complex, 
      which works as an activator of the export gate complex. Three transmembrane 
      proteins, FliP, FliQ, and FliR, form a core structure of the export gate complex, 
      and this core complex serves as a polypeptide channel that allows flagellar 
      structural subunits to be translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. Here, we 
      describe the methods for overproduction, solubilization, and purification of the 
      Salmonella FliP/FliQ/FliR complex.

AB  - The flagellar axial proteins are transported across the cytoplasmic membrane into 
      the central channel of the growing flagellum via the flagellar protein export 
      apparatus, a member of the type III secretion system (T3SS). To reveal the 
      molecular mechanism of protein transport by the T3SS, accurate measurement of 
      protein transport under various conditions is essential. In this chapter, we 
      describe an in vitro method for flagellar protein transport assay using inverted 
      membrane vesicles (IMVs) prepared from Salmonella cells. This method can easily 
      and precisely control the condition around the T3SS and be applied to other 
      T3SSs.

AB  - Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and parallel cascade selection molecular 
      dynamics (PaCS-MD) are widely used to investigate large-amplitude motions of 
      proteins. PaCS-MD is an enhanced conformational sampling method consisting of 
      cycles of parallel unbiased MD simulations combined with a selection of MD 
      snapshots as the initial structures for the next cycle. In addition, free energy 
      calculation can be achieved by the combination of PaCS-MD and the Markov state 
      model (MSM). In this chapter, the protocols to investigate the open-close motion 
      of a flagellar export apparatus protein, FlhA(C), by MD and the combination of 
      PaCS-MD and MSM are described.

AB  - Bacterial flagella are molecular machines used for motility and chemotaxis. The 
      flagellum consists of a thin extracellular helical filament as a propeller, a 
      short hook as a universal joint, and a basal body as a rotary motor. The filament 
      is made up of more than 20,000 flagellin molecules and can grow to several 
      micrometers long but only 20 nanometers thick. The regulation of flagellar 
      assembly and ejection is important for bacterial environmental adaptation. 
      However, due to the technical difficulty to observe these nanostructures in live 
      cells, our understanding of the flagellar growth and loss is limited. In the last 
      three decades, the development of fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence 
      labeling of specific cellular structure has made it possible to perform the 
      real-time observation of bacterial flagellar assembly and ejection processes. 
      Furthermore, flagella are not only critical for bacterial motility but also 
      important antigens stimulating host immune responses. The complete understanding 
      of bacterial flagellar production and ejection is valuable for understanding 
      macromolecular self-assembly, cell adaptation, and pathogen-host interactions.

AB  - The bacterial flagellum is a large assembly of about 30 different proteins and is 
      divided into three parts: the filament that acts as a screw propeller, the hook 
      as a universal joint, and the basal body as a rotary motor. In the case of 
      Salmonella, the filament length is 10-15 μm, which is more than ten times longer 
      than the size of the cell. The filament is composed of only one component 
      protein, flagellin, and is made of 11 protofilaments. The filament can form 12 
      different supercoiled structures as polymorphic forms. Each protofilament can 
      take either the L (left-handed) or R (right-handed) state, and the number ratio 
      of the protofilaments in these two states determines the shape of the supercoil. 
      Some point mutations in flagellin make the filament straight by making all the 
      protofilaments in one of the two states. The straight filaments enable us to use 
      their helical symmetries for structural analysis by electron cryomicroscopy 
      (cryoEM) and single particle image analysis. Here, we describe the methods for 
      the purification of the flagellar filament and cryoEM data collection and image 
      analysis.

AB  - The bacterial flagellum employs a rotary motor embedded on the cell surface. The 
      motor consists of the stator and rotor elements and is driven by ion influx 
      (typically H(+) or Na(+)) through an ion channel of the stator. Ion influx 
      induces conformational changes in the stator, followed by changes in the 
      interactions between the stator and rotor. The driving force to rotate the 
      flagellum is thought to be generated by changing the stator-rotor interactions. 
      In this chapter, we describe two methods for investigating the interactions 
      between the stator and rotor: site-directed in vivo photo-crosslinking and 
      site-directed in vivo cysteine disulfide crosslinking.

AB  - The bacterial flagellum is driven by a rotational motor located at the base of 
      the flagellum. The stator unit complex conducts cations such as protons (H(+)) 
      and sodium ions (Na(+)) along the electrochemical potential across the 
      cytoplasmic membrane and interacts with the rotor to generate the rotational 
      force. Escherichia coli and Salmonella have the H(+)-type stator complex, which 
      serves as a transmembrane H(+) channel that couples H(+) flow through an ion 
      channel to torque generation whereas Vibrio and some Bacillus species have the 
      Na(+)-type stator complex. In this chapter, we describe how to measure the ion 
      conductivity of the transmembrane stator complex over-expressed in E. coli cells 
      using fluorescent indicators. Intensity measurements of fluorescent indicators 
      using either a fluorescence spectrophotometer or microscope allow quantitative 
      detection of changes in the intracellular ion concentrations due to the ion 
      channel activity of the transmembrane protein complex.

AB  - The flagellar motor of marine Vibrio is driven by the sodium-motive force across 
      the inner membrane. The stator complex, consisting of two membrane proteins PomA 
      and PomB, is responsible for energy conversion in the motor. To understand the 
      coupling of the Na(+) flux with torque generation, it is essential to clearly 
      identify the Na(+)-binding sites and the Na(+) flux pathway through the stator 
      channel. Although residues essential for Na(+) flux have been identified by using 
      mutational analysis, it has been difficult to observe Na(+) binding to the PomAB 
      stator complex. Here we describe a method to monitor the binding of Na(+) to 
      purified PomAB stator complex using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier 
      transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. This method demonstrates that 
      Na(+)-binding sites are formed by critical aspartic acid and threonine residues 
      located in the transmembrane segments of PomAB.

AB  - The stator unit of the bacterial flagellar motor coordinates the number of active 
      stators in the motor by sensing changes in external load and ion motive force 
      across the cytoplasmic membrane. The structural dynamics of the stator unit at 
      the single-molecule level is key to understanding the sensing mechanism and motor 
      assembly. High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) is a powerful tool for 
      directly observing dynamically acting biological molecules with high 
      spatiotemporal resolution without interfering with their function. Here, we 
      describe protocols for single-molecule imaging of the Na(+)-driven MotPS stator 
      complex by HS-AFM.

AB  - The bacterial flagellar motor is embedded within the cell envelop and rotates the 
      long helical filament, which acts as a molecular screw to propel the bacterium. 
      The flagellar motor comprises a rotor and a dozen stator units, converting ion 
      flux through the stator unit into torque. However, the energy coupling mechanism 
      has not been fully understood. Various methods for rotation measurement have been 
      developed to understand the rotation mechanism of the flagellar motor, but the 
      most preferred method in recent studies is a bead assay, which tracks the 
      rotation of a micron to submicron bead attached to the partially sheared 
      flagellar filament at high temporal and spatial resolutions. The bead assay 
      allows us to assess the motor rotation over a wide range of external load, but 
      the elasticity of the axial parts of the flagellum, such as the hook and 
      filament, limits the spatiotemporal resolution. In this chapter, we describe a 
      bead assay optimized for the analysis of the flagellar motor dynamics at near 
      zero load.

AB  - The assessment of intracellular dynamics is crucial for understanding the 
      function and formation process of bacterial organelle, just as it is for the 
      inquisition of their eukaryotic counterparts. The methods for imaging magnetosome 
      organelles in a magnetotactic bacterial cell using live-cell fluorescence imaging 
      by highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HILO) microscopy are presented in 
      this chapter. Furthermore, we introduce methods for pH imaging in magnetosome 
      lumen as an application of fluorescence magnetosome imaging.

AB  - Salmonella enterica has six subspecies, of which the subspecies enterica is the 
      most important for human health. The dispersal and infectivity of this species 
      are dependent upon flagella-driven motility. Two kinds of flagella-mediated 
      movements have been described-swimming individually in bulk liquid and swarming 
      collectively over a surface substrate. During swarming, the bacteria acquire a 
      distinct physiology, the most significant consequence of which is acquisition of 
      adaptive resistance to antibiotics. Described here are protocols to cultivate, 
      verify, and study swimming and swarming motility in S. enterica, and an 
      additional "border-crossing" assay, where cells "primed" to swarm are presented 
      with an environmental challenge such as antibiotics to assess their propensity to 
      handle the challenge.

AB  - Spirochetes are Gram-negative bacteria with helical or flat wave morphology and 
      move using flagella residing beneath the outer membrane. Most commonly, 
      flagellated bacteria swim in liquid. Meanwhile, some species of spirochete not 
      only swim but keep moving after adhering to solid surfaces, and such amphibious 
      motility is believed to be significant for pathogenicity. This chapter focuses on 
      the zoonotic spirochete Leptospira and describes the method for measuring the 
      spirochete adhesion and surface motility.

AB  - Velocity is a physical parameter most commonly used to quantify bacterial 
      swimming. In the steady-state motion at a low Reynolds number, the swimming force 
      can be estimated from the swimming velocity and the drag coefficient based on the 
      assumption that the swimming force balances with the drag force exerted on the 
      bacterium. Though the velocity-force relation provides a significant clue to 
      understand the swimming mechanism, the odd configuration of bacteria could 
      develop problems with the accuracy of the force estimation. This chapter 
      describes the force measurement using optical tweezers. The method uses 
      parameters obtained from the shape and movement of a microsphere attached to the 
      bacteria, improving the quantitativeness of force measurement.

AB  - Swimming archaea are propelled by a filamentous structure called the archaellum. 
      The first step for the structural characterization of this filament is its 
      isolation. Here we provide various methods that allow for the isolation of 
      archaella filaments from well-studied archaeal model organisms. Archaella 
      filaments have been successfully extracted from organisms belonging to different 
      archaeal phyla, e.g., euryarchaeal methanogens such as Methanococcus voltae, and 
      crenarchaeal hyperthermoacidophiles like Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. The filament 
      isolation protocols that we provide in this chapter follow one of two strategies: 
      either the filaments are sheared or extracted from whole cells by detergent 
      extraction, prior to further final purification by centrifugation methods.

AB  - Single-molecular techniques have characterized dynamics of molecular motors such 
      as flagellum in bacteria and myosin, kinesin, and dynein in eukaryotes. We can 
      apply these techniques to a motility machine of archaea, namely, the archaellum, 
      composed of a thin helical filament and a rotary motor. Although the size of the 
      motor hinders the characterization of its motor function under a conventional 
      optical microscope, fluorescence-labeling techniques allow us to visualize the 
      architecture and function of the archaellar filaments in real time. Furthermore, 
      a tiny polystyrene bead attached to the filament enables the visualization of 
      motor rotation through the bead rotation and quantification of biophysical 
      properties such as speed and torque produced by the rotary motor imbedded in the 
      cell membrane. In this chapter, I describe the details of the above biophysical 
      method based on an optical microscope.

AB  - Bacterial surface nanomachines are often refractory to structural determination 
      in their intact form due to their extensive association with the cell envelope 
      preventing them from being properly purified for traditional structural biology 
      methods. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is an emerging branch of 
      cryo-electron microscopy that can visualize supramolecular complexes directly 
      inside frozen-hydrated cells in 3D at nanometer resolution, therefore posing a 
      unique capability to study the intact structures of bacterial surface 
      nanomachines in situ and reveal their molecular association with other cellular 
      components. Furthermore, the resolution of cryo-ET is continually improving 
      alongside methodological advancement. Here, using the type IV pilus machine in 
      Myxococcus xanthus as an example, we describe a step-by-step workflow for in situ 
      structure determination including sample preparation and screening, microscope 
      and camera tuning, tilt series acquisition, data processing and tomogram 
      reconstruction, subtomogram averaging, and structural analysis.

AB  - Bacterial twitching motility is a peculiar way of adherence and surface 
      translocation on moist solid or semisolid surfaces. Although the twitching 
      motility has been detected in various flagellated bacteria, such as Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa, it has been rarely detected in flagella-less bacteria like Lysobacter 
      enzymogenes, a natural predator of filamentous fungi. Here, by using a strain 
      OH11 of L. enzymogenes as a model system, we describe a convenient method for 
      observing the twitching motility, with fewer steps and better repetition than 
      conventional methods. This new method provides important technical support for 
      the motile study of Lysobacter.

AB  - Many cyanobacteria show directional movement either toward or away from light 
      sources. The cell movement, also known as twitching motility, is usually driven 
      by type IV pili (T4P), a bacterial molecular machine. The machine generates a 
      propulsion force through repeated cycles of extension and retraction of pilus 
      filaments. Here, I describe a phototaxis assay for observing Synechocystis sp. 
      PCC6803 and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus at the single-cell level with optical 
      microscopy. By adding fluorescent beads, I also describe a method how to 
      visualize the asymmetric activation of T4P during phototaxis.

AB  - Many members of the phylum Bacteroidota (formerly called Bacteroidetes) adhere to 
      and move on solid surfaces. This type of bacterial motility is called gliding and 
      does not involve the conventional bacterial motility machinery, such as flagella 
      and pili. To understand the mechanism of gliding motility of some Bacteroidota 
      bacteria such as a soil bacterium Flavobacterium johnsoniae and a marine 
      bacterium Saprospira grandis, the gliding motility machines of these two bacteria 
      have been analyzed by electron microscopy with negative staining. Here, we 
      describe methods to directly observe the gliding motility machinery in 
      Bacteroidota by transmission electron microscopy.

AB  - Many phylum Bacteroidetes bacteria are motile without either flagella or pili. 
      These cells move on surfaces such as glass or agar, and a motor generates a 
      propulsion force for the cells via a proton motive force across the cytoplasmic 
      membrane. The gliding motility depends on the helical track of cell adhesin along 
      the longer axis of the cell body. Here, we describe live-cell imaging of gliding 
      motility under optical microscopy, as well as an immunofluorescent labeling 
      method for visualizing helical trajectories.

AB  - Flavobacterium johnsoniae cells move rapidly over solid surfaces by gliding 
      motility. The collective migration of F. johnsoniae on the surfaces results in 
      the formation of spreading colonies. Colony spreading is influenced by adhesin 
      components on the cell surface and the concentrations of agar and glucose. For 
      example, on nutrient-poor agar media, film-like, round spreading colonies are 
      formed. F. johnsoniae displays at least two types of migration: small cell 
      cluster movements leading to concentric colonies and individual cell movements 
      leading to dendritic colonies. The methods for observing colony morphology are 
      described in this chapter.

AB  - Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential component of the bacterial cell wall that 
      protects the cell from turgor pressure and maintains its shape. In diderm 
      (gram-negative) bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the PG layer is flexible with 
      a thickness of a 2-6 nm, and its visualization is difficult due to the presence 
      of the outer membrane. The quick-freeze deep-etch replica method has been widely 
      used for the visualization of flexible structures in cell interior, such as cell 
      organelles and membrane components. In this technique, a platinum replica on the 
      surface of a specimen fixed by freezing is observed using a transmission electron 
      microscope. In this chapter, we describe the application of this method for 
      visualizing the E. coli PG layer. We expect that these methods will be useful for 
      the visualization of the PG layer in diverse bacterial species.

AB  - Isolating functional units from large insoluble protein complexes are a complex 
      but valuable approach for quantitative and structural analysis. Mycoplasma 
      mobile, a gliding bacterium, contains a large insoluble protein complex called 
      gliding machinery. The machinery contains several chain structures formed by 
      motors that are evolutionarily related to the F(1)-ATPase. Recently, we developed 
      a method to purify functional motors and their chain structures using Triton 
      X-100 and a high salt concentration buffer and resolved their structures using 
      electron microscopy. In this chapter, we describe the processes of purification 
      and structural analysis of functional motors for the gliding of M. mobile using 
      negative-staining electron microscopy.

AB  - Mycoplasma mobile forms a membrane protrusion at a pole as an organelle. M. 
      mobile cells bind to solid surfaces and glide in the direction of the protrusion. 
      In gliding motility, M. mobile cells catch, pull and release sialylated 
      oligosaccharides on host cells. The observation of Mycoplasma species under light 
      microscopy is useful for the analysis of adhesion ability and the motility 
      mechanism.

AB  - Mycoplasma mobile is one of the fastest gliding bacteria, gliding with a speed of 
      4.5 μm s(-1). This gliding motility is driven by a concerted movement of 450 
      supramolecular motor units composed of three proteins, Gli123, Gli349, and 
      Gli521, in the gliding motility machinery. With general experimental setups, it 
      is difficult to obtain the information on how each motor unit works. This chapter 
      describes strategies to decrease the number of active motor units to extract 
      stepwise cell movements driven by a minimum number of motor units. We also 
      describe an unforeseen motility mode in which the leg motions convert the gliding 
      motion into rotary motion, which enables us to characterize the motor torque and

AB  - Optical tweezers enable us to measure the force generated by bacterial motility 
      and motor proteins. Here, we describe a method, using optical tweezers and 
      related techniques, to measure the force generated during Mycoplasma gliding. An 
      avidin-conjugated polystyrene bead trapped by a focused laser beam is bound to 
      the surface-biotinylated Mycoplasma cell, which pulls the bead from the trap 
      center of the laser. The force generated by Mycoplasma is calculated from a 
      displacement measured and a spring constant of the laser trap.

AB  - Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a small cell wall-lacking bacterium that is a common 
      cause of bronchitis and pneumonia in humans. In addition to its clinical 
      importance, M. pneumoniae has recently been considered a promising model organism 
      for synthetic biology because of its small genome size and unique cell structure. 
      At one cell pole, M. pneumoniae forms the attachment organelle that is 
      responsible for adherence to host cells and gliding motility. The attachment 
      organelle is a membrane protrusion and is composed of number of molecules, 
      including adhesin and cytoskeletal proteins. Genetic manipulation techniques are 
      key research approaches for understanding the structure and the function of this 
      unique molecular machinery. In this chapter, standard genetic engineering methods 
      for this species using the Tn4001 transposon vector are described.

PG  - 359-371

AB  - Spiroplasma is a genus of wall-less helical bacteria with swimming motility 
      unrelated to conventional types of bacterial motility machinery, such as flagella 
      and pili. The swimming of Spiroplasma is suggested to be driven by five classes 
      of MreB (MreB1-MreB5), which are members of the actin superfamily. In 
      vitro studies of Spiroplasma MreBs have recently been conducted to evaluate their 
      activities, such as ATPase, which is essential for the polymerization dynamics 
      among classic actin superfamily proteins. In this chapter, we describe methods of 
      purification and P(i) release measurement of Spiroplasma MreBs using column 
      chromatography and absorption spectroscopy with the molecular probe, 
      2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside (MESG). Of note, the methods described 
      here are applicable to other proteins that possess NTPase activity.

AB  - Spiroplasma swim in liquids without the use of the bacterial flagella. This small 
      helical bacterium propels itself by generating kinks that travel down the cell 
      body. The kink translation is unidirectional, from the leading pole to the 
      lagging pole, during cell swimming in viscous environments. This protocol 
      describes a swimming motility assay of Spiroplasma eriocheiris for visualizing 
      kink translations of the absolute handedness of the body helix with optical 
      microscopy.

AB  - Chloroflexus is a thermophilic, filamentous, gliding bacterium. Its multicellular 
      filaments of several hundred micrometer length move straightforward at a speed of 
      approximately 1-3 μm/s and occasionally reverse the moving direction. In liquid 
      media, filaments glide on each other to form cell aggregates without tight 
      adhesion. The molecular machinery on the cell surface that forces the gliding 
      movement has not yet been identified. Here, we describe the cultivation methods 
      to characterize the gliding motility of Chlroflexus and the microscopic assays to 
      determine its gliding speed, reversal frequency, and cell-surface movements.

      adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma: a single-centre retrospective study.
LID - 10.1007/s13304-023-01475-x [doi]
AB  - Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) has became the standardized treatment for 
      pheochromocytoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of lateral 
      transperitoneal and retroperitoneal LA for pheochromocytoma. Between January 2011 
      and December 2021, 142 patients with pheochromocytoma underwent LA via lateral 
      transperitoneal (123 patients) or retroperitoneal (19 patients) approaches. Data 
      of these patients were assessed to investigate the differences in perioperative 
      outcomes and intraoperative haemodynamic parameters between the two procedures. 
      Clinical parameters at presentation were comparable between the two groups, 
      except for tumour size, which was larger in the transperitoneal group (50 
      [10-115] mm vs 35 [7-110] mm, P = 0.012). There were no significant differences 
      between the two groups in terms of operation time, estimated blood loss, 
      intraoperative transfusion rate, incidence of complications, conversion to open 
      surgery, postoperative analgesic requirement, time to first oral intake, or mean 
      hospital stay. Intraoperative haemodynamic parameters of the two groups were 
      similar. After adjusting for tumour size using propensity score matching, both 
      perioperative outcomes and haemodynamic parameters were still comparable. Lateral 
      transperitoneal and retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomies provide similar 
      perioperative and haemodynamic outcomes for surgical resection of 
      pheochromocytoma.

TI  - Outcome of Uveitis in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Spondyloarthritis 
      Patients - A 5-Year Follow-Up Study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Uveitis is a frequent complication of juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
      (JIA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA). The aim of this study is to evaluate the 
      prevalence and risk factors for complications associated with uveitis in patients 
      with JIA and SpA. METHODS: A longitudinal, monocentric cohort study that included 
      patients diagnosed with JIA and SpA who developed uveitis. Demographic, 
      laboratory, and clinical data were collected including complications of uveitis, 
      HLA-B27, antinuclear antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive 
      protein, visual acuity and DMARD treatment. Comparison between groups 
      (complicated versus uncomplicated uveitis) was evaluated using chi-square, t test 
      and Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression was performed to determine 
      predictors of complications. RESULTS: A total of 270 patients were evaluated, of 
      which 37 patients (13.7%) had uveitis and were included in this study. Twenty 
      patients were female (54.1%), aged 11.9±8.7 years at diagnosis of SpA/JIA and 
      15.3±9.9 years at diagnosis of uveitis. Twenty-seven patients (73.0%) had a 
      diagnosis of JIA (23 with oligoarticular disease) and in 12 patients (32.4%) 
      uveitis was the first manifestation. Fifteen (40.5%) patients exhibited 
      complications during follow-up period. Eleven patients (29.7%) underwent 
      ophthalmologic surgery. Complications were significantly higher in patients with 
      JIA (51.9% vs 10.0% in SpA, p=0.03), as was the need for surgery (40.7% vs 0%, 
      p=0.02). Complications in JIA were significantly more frequent in patients who 
      had uveitis as the initial presentation (50.0% vs 7.7%, p=0.03); no significant 
      differences were found between the groups in the other variables studied. 
      Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that uveitis as the first 
      manifestation of JIA (OR 12.0, confidence interval 95% 1.21-118.89, p=0.03) is a 
      significant predictor of complications. CONCLUSION: We found higher rates of 
      complications and need for ophthalmologic surgery in patients with JIA-associated 
      uveitis. The initial presentation of JIA as uveitis is significantly associated 
      with the occurrence of uveitis complications, so it is essential that there is a 
      collaboration between ophthalmologist and rheumatologist in the diagnosis and 
      treatment of these patients.

TI  - Using social norm nudges in supermarket shopping trolleys to increase fruit and 
      vegetable purchases.
PG  - 115-123
LID - 10.1111/nbu.12604 [doi]
AB  - Fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption is associated with a reduced risk of 
      developing obesity and chronic diseases: however, only one in twenty Australian 
      adults consume F&Vs at the recommended two servings of fruit and five servings of 
      vegetables per day. What and how much people eat is influenced by their social 
      and physical environments. Supermarkets are a key setting influencing food 
      purchases, and as such, they can shape consumption patterns of F&Vs. Implementing 
      effective strategies to increase F&V intake is crucial. The objective of this 
      research was to test if shopper purchasing behaviour can be modified to purchase 
      more F&Vs using social norm nudge messages (prompts) placed in shopping trolleys. 
      Placards giving the message that the majority of shoppers purchased F&Vs at each 
      shop were placed in shopping trolleys. Applying an intervention research design, 
      30 out of ~100 trolleys were fitted with the placards and shopper purchases were 
      measured by collecting receipts to measure the quantity (kg), total and F&V 
      spending (Australian dollars) for intervention versus control trolleys. We also 
      conducted a short intercept survey that was administered independently from the 
      research study day. Shoppers who selected trolleys with the social norm nudge 
      placards (n = 109) purchased 1.25 kg more F&Vs (Intervention: mean = 5.45 kg, 
      SD = 4.23 kg, 95% CI 4.65 kg, 6.26 kg vs. Control: mean 4.19 kg, SD = 3.75 kg, 
      95% CI 3.48 kg, 4.90 kg, p = 0.020, Cohen's d = 0.32) and spent an extra $9.10 
      more on F&Vs compared to shoppers in the control group (n = 109; Intervention: 
      mean = $36.20, SD = $26.30, 95% CI = $31.24, $41.26 vs. Control: mean $27.10, 
      SD = $24.00, 95% CI = $22.50, $31.67, p = 0.008, Cohen's d = 0.36). The social 
      norm nudge placard shows promise in modifying shoppers' purchases to buy more 
      F&Vs. Larger studies are required to elucidate and confirm these findings over 
      the longer term.

TI  - The impact of genetic variability on the relationship between caffeine and 
      cardiometabolic outcomes: A systematic review.
PG  - 28-42
LID - 10.1111/nbu.12606 [doi]
AB  - The relationship between caffeine consumption and cardiometabolic health has been 
      reported, however with heterogenous results. Discrepancies in study results may 
      be due to inter-individual variability between study participants. This 
      systematic review aimed to identify the impact of genetics on the relationship 
      between caffeine consumption and cardiometabolic outcomes. Electronic databases 
      (PubMed and EMBASE) were searched for studies published until July 2021. Selected 
      studies were of both intervention and observational design and included (1) 
      analysis of at least one of the selected cardiometabolic outcome (type 2 
      diabetes, glucose/insulin levels, cardiovascular disease [CVD], blood pressure 
      [BP] or hypertension, and blood lipid and catecholamine levels), (2) adults aged 
      18-65 years, and (3) genetic analysis of individuals consuming caffeine. 
      Seventeen studies were included: four randomised controlled trials and an 
      interventional and quasi-experimental study, six population-based prospective 
      cohort studies, three cross-sectional studies, and three case-control studies. 
      CYP1A2 rs762551 and ADORA rs5751876 were associated with glucose response when 
      caffeine was consumed with carbohydrates. CYP1A2 rs762551 moderated the 
      association between coffee intake and hypertension. Moreover, ADORA2A rs5751876 
      and the ADRA2B I variants moderated the associations between caffeine and BP. 
      Studies that investigated the effects of genetic variations on CVD and caffeine 
      consumption reported equivocal findings (CYP1A2) or warrant replication (COMT, 
      ADORA and TRIB1). Elucidating the extent to which these genes moderate the 
      association between caffeine and cardiometabolic outcomes will enable caffeine 
      consumption advice to be tailored to specific individuals to optimise health.

TI  - Technical note: First implementation of a one-stop solution of radiotherapy with 
      full-workflow automation based on CT-linac combination.
LID - 10.1002/mp.16324 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy initiation is a laborious and time-consuming process 
      that involves multiple steps and units. Workflow automation is in demand to 
      improve the work efficiency and patient experience. PURPOSE: The purposes of this 
      study are to describe the technical characteristics and clinical performance of 
      an AI-powered one-stop radiotherapy workflow for initial treatment based on 
      CT-linac combination, and provide insight into the behavior of full-workflow 
      automation in radiotherapy. METHODS: Based on a CT-integrated linear accelerator 
      and AI model implementation, the so-called "All-in-One" workflow incorporates 
      routine procedures from simulation, autosegmentation, autoplanning, image 
      guidance, beam delivery, and in vivo quality assurance (QA) into one scheme, 
      while the patient is on the treatment couch. Clinical outcomes of the new 
      workflow were evaluated for 10 enrolled patients with rectal cancer. RESULTS: For 
      the enrolled patients, manual modifications of the autosegmented target volumes 
      were necessary. The Dice similarity coefficient and 95% Hausdorff distance before 
      and after the modifications were 0.892 ± 0.061 and 18.2 ± 13.0 mm, respectively. 
      The autosegmented normal tissues and automatic plans were clinically acceptable 
      without any modifications or reoptimization. The pretreatment IGRT corrections 
      were within 2 mm in all directions, and the EPID-based in vivo QA showed γ 
      passing rate of above 97% (3%/3 mm/10% threshold) at all the checkpoints, better 
      than the results of rectal patients who followed a routine workflow. The duration 
      of the whole process was 23.2 ± 3.5 minutes for the enrolled patients, depending 
      mostly on the time required for manual modification and plan evaluation. 
      CONCLUSION: The All-in-One workflow enables full-process automation of 
      radiotherapy via seamless procedure integration. Compared to the routine 
      workflow, the one-stop solution shortens the time scale it takes to ready the 
      first treatment from days to minutes, significantly improving the patient 
      experience and the workflow efficiency, and it also shows potential to facilitate 
      clinical application of online adaptive replanning.

AB  - Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF/BANF) is a nuclear lamina protein 
      essential for nuclear integrity, chromatin structure, and genome stability. 
      Whereas complete loss of BAF causes lethality in multiple organisms, the A12T 
      missense mutation of the BANF1 gene in humans causes a premature aging syndrome, 
      called Néstor-Guillermo Progeria Syndrome (NGPS). Here, we report the first in 
      vivo animal investigation of progeroid BAF, using CRISPR editing to introduce the 
      NGPS mutation into the endogenous Drosophila baf gene. Progeroid BAF adults are 
      born at expected frequencies, demonstrating that this BAF variant retains some 
      function. However, tissue homeostasis is affected, supported by studies of the 
      ovary, a tissue that depends upon BAF for stem cell survival and continuous 
      oocyte production. We find that progeroid BAF causes defects in germline stem 
      cell mitosis that delay anaphase progression and compromise chromosome 
      segregation. We link these defects to decreased recruitment of centromeric 
      proteins of the kinetochore, indicating dysfunction of cenBAF, a localized pool 
      of dephosphorylated BAF produced by Protein Phosphatase PP4. We show that DNA 
      damage increases in progenitor germ cells, which causes germ cell death due to 
      activation of the DNA damage transducer kinase Chk2. Mitotic defects appear 
      widespread, as aberrant chromosome segregation and increased apoptosis occur in 
      another tissue. Together, these data highlight the importance of BAF in 
      establishing centromeric structures critical for mitosis. Further, these studies 
      link defects in cenBAF function to activation of a checkpoint that depletes 
      progenitor reserves critical for tissue homeostasis, aligning with phenotypes of 
      NGPS patients.

AB  - A theoretical model is used to describe the three-dimensional development of the 
      retinal circulation in the human eye, which occurs after the initial spread of 
      vasculature across the inner surface of the retina. In the model, random 
      sprouting angiogenesis is driven by a growth factor that is produced in tissue at 
      a rate dependent on oxygen level and diffuses to existing vessels. Vessel sprouts 
      connect to form pathways for blood flow and undergo remodeling and pruning. These 
      processes are controlled by known or hypothesized vascular responses to 
      hemodynamic and biochemical stimuli, including conducted responses along vessel 
      walls. The model shows regression of arterio-venous connections on the surface of 
      the retina, allowing perfusion of the underlying tissue. A striking feature of 
      the retinal circulation is the formation of two vascular plexuses located at the 
      inner and outer surfaces of the inner nuclear layer within the retina. The model 
      is used to test hypotheses regarding the formation of these structures. A 
      mechanism based on local production and diffusion of growth factor is shown to be 
      ineffective. However, sprout guidance by localized structures on the boundaries 
      of the inner nuclear layer can account for plexus formation. The resulting 
      networks have vascular density, perfusion and oxygen transport characteristics 
      consistent with observed properties. The model shows how stochastic generation of 
      vascular sprouts combined with a set of biologically based response mechanisms 
      can lead to the generation of a specialized three-dimensional vascular structure 
      with a high degree of organization.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gastric cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the digestive 
      system. The progression from gastritis to gastric cancer may be related to 
      genetic factors, but the specific molecular mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, 
      an in-depth study of the molecular mechanism of gastritis and gastric cancer is 
      significant. METHODS: We downloaded two gene profiles, GSE2669 and GSE116312, 
      from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. This study aims to apply 
      bioinformatics technology to mine differentially expressed genes (DEGs), DEGs 
      annotation, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network creation, and hub gene 
      identification and expression between gastric cancer patients and gastritis 
      patients. Overall survival analysis of hub genes, analysis by comparative 
      toxicogenomics database for hub genes in gastric cancer, THBS2 and VCAN protein 
      expression by immunohistochemistry for gastric cancer and gastritis as well as 
      design of the biological process (BP) neural network was implemented. RESULTS: 
      The MSLN, SPP1, THBS2, SPARC, FN1, IGFBP7, VCAN were up-regulated in gastric 
      carcinoma samples, while FGA was down-regulated. The protein expression of THBS2 
      and VCAN in gastric cancer was significantly higher than that in gastritis. VCAN 
      protein expression was positively associated with tumor invasion (P = 0.011) and 
      HER2 overexpression (P = 0.031). Strong correlation among THBS2, VCAN, and 
      gastric cancer based on the BP neural network. CONCLUSION: THBS2 and VCAN may be 
      potential targets for improving gastric cancer patients' diagnosis and clinical 
      efficacy.

AB  - Numerous studies have documented that immune responses are crucial in the 
      pathophysiology of spinal cord injury (SCI). Our study aimed to uncover the 
      function of immune-related genes (IRGs) in SCI. Here, we comprehensively 
      evaluated the transcriptome data of SCI and healthy controls (HC) obtained from 
      the GEO Database integrating bioinformatics and experiments. First, a total of 
      2067 DEGs were identified between the SCI and HC groups. Functional enrichment 
      analysis revealed substantial immune-related pathways and functions that were 
      abnormally activated in the SCI group. Immune analysis revealed that myeloid 
      immune cells were predominantly upregulated in SCI patients, while a large number 
      of lymphoid immune cells were dramatically downregulated. Subsequently, 51 major 
      IRGs were screened as key genes involved in SCI based on the intersection of the 
      results of WGCNA analysis, DEGs, and IRGs. Based on the expression profiles of 
      these genes, two distinct immune modulation patterns were recognized exhibiting 
      opposite immune characteristics. Moreover, 2 core IRGs (FCER1G and NFATC2) were 
      determined to accurately predict the occurrence of SCI via machine learning. qPCR 
      analysis was used to validate the expression of core IRGs in an external 
      independent cohort. Finally, the expression of these core IRGs was validated by 
      sequencing, WB, and IF analysis in vivo. We found that these two core IRGs were 
      closely associated with immune cells and verified the co-localization of FCER1G 
      with macrophage M1 via IF analysis. Our study revealed the key role of 
      immune-related genes in SCI and contributed to a fresh perspective for early 
      diagnosis and treatment of SCI.

TI  - Adolescent risk and protection profiles for violence perpetration: Insights for 
      family- and community-based prevention.
LID - 10.1002/ab.22077 [doi]
AB  - Youth violence continues to be a major developmental and health concern. 
      Preventative resources at individual, family, and community levels may reduce 
      risk, yet the extent to which youth violence perpetration differs by patterns of 
      risk and protective factors remains unknown. Using data from the Florida Youth 
      Substance Abuse Survey (N = 4630; 49% female; M(age)  = 14.69), we conducted 
      person-centered, latent profile analyses to identify four patterns for risk of 
      violence perpetration among middle and high school youth. Youth in the Low 
      Risk-High Protection profile (37%) had low likelihood of violence perpetration. 
      Youth in the Low Risk-Low Protection profile (4%) were characterized by poor 
      family functioning, low school belonging, and low community protection. These 
      youth had similar odds of violence perpetration as youth in the Moderate 
      Risk-Moderate Protection profile (44%), which were elevated compared to the Low 
      Risk-High Protection profile. Youth in the High Risk-Low Protection profile 
      (15%), which had the highest levels of risk factors and lowest levels of 
      protective factors, had the highest likelihood of violence perpetration. The High 
      Risk-Low Protection profile was expected based on past research, but the 
      emergence of the Low Risk-Low Protection profile is a unique contribution to the 
      research. Findings contribute to the literature by going beyond a cumulative risk 
      model, identifying subgroups with various patterns of risk and protection in the 
      population, and highlighting the importance of selected prevention for subgroups 
      of youth with high risk or challenging family and community environments.

TI  - A daily diary study on stressors, hurt feelings, aggression, and somatic 
      symptoms: The role of rejection sensitivity and negative emotion differentiation.
LID - 10.1002/ab.22076 [doi]
AB  - The current study adopted a daily diary design to examine associations of daily 
      stressors and hurt feelings to three unfavorable daily outcomes, including verbal 
      aggression, physical aggression, and somatic symptoms and the moderation of 
      rejection sensitivity and negative emotion regulation on the relations between 
      these daily variables. A total of 248 college students participated in the daily 
      diary study in which they responded to the assessment on a daily basis for 7 
      consecutive days. The results indicated that daily stressors predicted daily 
      verbal aggression; daily stressors, daily hurt feelings, and rejection 
      sensitivity predicted somatic symptoms. Negative emotion regulation moderated the 
      association between stressors and verbal aggression such that more stressors and 
      high negative emotion regulation predicted more frequent daily verbal aggression. 
      Rejection sensitivity moderated the association of hurt feelings to verbal and 
      physical aggression. Perception of hurt feelings and high rejection sensitivity 
      predicted more verbal aggression but less physical aggression. Rejection 
      sensitivity also moderated the association of stressors to somatic symptoms such 
      that more stressors and high rejection sensitivity predicted more somatic 
      symptoms. The findings collectively highlight the importance of supporting 
      individuals with high rejection sensitivity to encode social cues in a healthy 
      way. It is imperative to provide emotion regulation skills to cope with negative 
      emotions derived from social interactions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss is a sensory impairment that impairs speech 
      understanding, communication and therefore the quality of life. Sometimes the 
      patient's perceived loss of function is exaggerated; subjective and objective 
      test results are inconsistent, the subjectively reported hearing loss is more 
      significant, and in these cases functional hearing loss is considered. OBJECTIVE: 
      Our aim was to collect and retrospectively analyze cases with the diagnosis of 
      functional hearing loss, in order to draw conclusions about the characteristics 
      of functional hearing loss, the signs and conditions that may be of attention and 
      the consideration of appropriate rehabilitation. METHODS: Subjective tests were 
      performed with pure-tone auditory threshold, speech understanding and 
      communication tests, which were compared with the results obtained with objective 
      impedance measurements, stapedial reflex tests, otoacoustic emission 
      measurements, and brainstem evoked response recordings. Imaging studies, 
      psychologist, psychiatrist, neurologist, neurologist and other co-specialists 
      were involved as needed. We excluded cases of deception deliberately intended to 
      obtain financial or other benefits. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2022, 19 patients 
      were diagnosed with functional hearing loss. The majority (17 cases) were female, 
      the complaints were prevalent at a young age (10-41 years); the average age in 
      the study population was 19.6 years, and the majority of patients (13 cases) were 
      children aged 10-17 years. No organic cause was found in 11 cases, and in the 
      remaining cases no detectable organic abnormality explained the extent of the 
      hearing loss experienced by the patient. The degree of functional hearing loss 
      varied (35-120 dB), with an average of 60,2 dB. CONCLUSION: Recognizing and 
      diagnosing functional hearing loss is very difficult and requires a complex 
      series of tests and professional cooperation. Without recognition, the patient 
      may receive unjustified, even harmful and financially burdensome care, which may 
      lead to the deterioration of his condition. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(8): 283-292.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Placental perfusion can be evaluated using three-dimensional 
      power-Doppler (3DPD) indices with sonobiopsy acquisition in a sphere or 
      throughout the entire placenta. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the relation 
      between these two measurement methods. METHOD: A prospective cohort study was 
      conducted among normal pregnant women recruited at 11 to 40 gestational weeks. 
      Placental vascularization was evaluated using the 3DPD indices (vascularization 
      index [VI]; flow index [FI]; vascularization flow index [VFI]) with the 
      application of the sphere ultrasound technique or scanned from the entire 
      placenta. RESULTS: A total of 150 women were recruited at a mean gestational age 
      of 20.8 ± 7.22 weeks. We observed that scanned 3DPD indices using sphere 
      technique decrease by gestational age between 11 and 40 weeks, whereas whole 
      placental volume scanning yielded stable, non-decreasing indices during 
      gestation. The indices were correlated to each other at least moderately, 
      irrespectively of the method of scanning (r≥0.30). LIMITATIONS: As gestation 
      advances, less and less placentas can be visualized in one sweep for a whole view 
      and at late period of gestation only a minority of placentas can be visualized as 
      a whole. CONCLUSION: 3DPD indices acquired in a sphere of the placenta at 
      umbilical cord insertion may reflect more to the decreasing vascularity of the 
      exponentially growing placenta during gestation. Hence, sphere technique may have 
      a greater screening opportunity in pathological pregnancies. Orv Hetil. 2023; 
      164(8): 300-307.

      three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiographic MAGYAR-Sport and MAGYAR-Path 
      Studies].

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acromegaly is a chronic endocrine disorder, which produces a 
      significant amount of human growth hormone and consequently insulin-like growth 
      factor in adulthood due to a tumor in the pituitary gland. If left untreated, it 
      can have a significant effect on the cardiovascular system. It is also known that 
      elite sport activity is also associated with physiologic cardiac transformation, 
      the so-called athletes' heart, in which volumetric and functional adaptation of 
      the heart cavities can be observed. OBJECTIVE: In accordance with the above 
      facts, the question may rightly arise as to what differences can be observed in 
      left ventricular morphology and function in acromegaly, and what similarities and 
      dissimilarities do the obtained results show compared to the values of healthy 
      non-athlete adults compared to the values of the left ventricle of young elite 
      athletes. METHOD: The present study comprised 21 elite athletes playing high 
      dynamic sports (mean age: 31.2 ± 6.4 years, 13 males) and 18 acromegaly patients 
      (mean age: 47.9 ± 8.9 years, 9 males). Their results were compared to those of 22 
      negative controls (mean age: 47.7 ± 10.6 years, 13 males). RESULTS: Left 
      ventricle is dilated, but its function is preserved in both elite athletes and 
      patients with acromegaly. While increased longitudinal and circumferential left 
      ventricular strains could be seen in elite athletes primarily due to the more 
      pronounced contractility of left ventricular apical segments, increased radial 
      left ventricular strain was detected in acromegaly due to increased function of 
      the left ventricular basal region. Left ventricular rotational mechanics show 
      different patterns as well: while basal left ventricular rotation is decreased in 
      elite athletes, apical left ventricular rotation showed a reduction leading to 
      the significant deterioration of left ventricular twist in acromegaly. 
      CONCLUSION: Both elite athletes playing high dynamic sports and acromegaly 
      patients have dilated left ventricle, more pronounced regional left ventricular 
      contractility and left ventricular rotational abnormalities with differences in 
      nature and extent of these alterations as compared to those of non-sporting 
      healthy subjects. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(8): 308-316.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aggressive behavior among psychiatric patients occurs the most 
      frequently during acute inpatient treatment causing significant safety risk for 
      patients and staff. OBJECTIVE: As part of a risk-reducing project targeting the 
      reduction of the frequency of physical aggression, a daily routine use of a risk 
      evaluation tool was introduced in the acute psychiatric unit of the Jahn Ferenc 
      South Pest Hospital. METHODS: Selection of the appropriate risk evaluation tool 
      was based on a thorough search of the literature. After preparing the Hungarian 
      translation of V-RISK-10, all acutely admitted patients were assessed with this 
      rating scale completed by the duty psychiatrist. To evaluate the predictive 
      validity of the scale, the authors retrospectively surveyed the number and length 
      of necessary physical restraints due to aggressive behavior in the first week 
      after admission. RESULTS: The mean score on V-RISK-10 was 6.78 ± 3.36 points and 
      the time patients spent under restraints was 6.96 ± 17.21 hours. The sum score of 
      the V-RISK-10 showed a moderate strength, and significant correlation with the 
      time spent under restraint (r = 0.447; p = 0.001). DISCUSSION: The results 
      confirmed that V-RISK-10 is an appropriate tool for predicting physical 
      aggression necessitating restraints in the first days following an acute 
      psychiatric admission. History of violent behavior, drug use, and a psychiatric 
      diagnosis and suspiciousness among current symptoms had the strongest predictive 
      value. CONCLUSION: The V-RISK-10 is a risk assessment tool that is user-friendly 
      in the context of acute psychiatric inpatient care and has a moderate power for 
      predicting aggressive behavior. Patients with high risk of aggression can be 
      identified with this tool at the time of admission. With careful monitoring and 
      timely initiation of aggression prevention strategies, the occurrence of 
      aggressive behavior can be minimized. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(8): 293-299.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is crucial for plant growth and development, especially in 
      physiological and biochemical processes such as component of different proteins, 
      enzymes, nucleic acids, and plant growth regulators. Six categories, such as 
      transporters, nitrate absorption, signal molecules, amino acid biosynthesis, 
      transcription factors, and miscellaneous genes, broadly encompass the genes 
      regulating NUE in various cereal crops. Herein, we outline detailed research on 
      bioengineering modifications of N metabolism to improve the different crop yields 
      and biomass. We emphasize effective and precise molecular approaches and 
      technologies, including N transporters, transgenics, omics, etc., which are 
      opening up fascinating opportunities for a complete analysis of the molecular 
      elements that contribute to NUE. Moreover, the detection of various types of N 
      compounds and associated signaling pathways within plant organs have been 
      discussed. Finally, we highlight the broader impacts of increasing NUE in crops, 
      crucial for better agricultural yield and in the greater context of global 
      climate change.

AB  - There is an urgent need to understand severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-host interactions involved in virus spread and 
      pathogenesis, which might contribute to the identification of new therapeutic 
      targets. In this study, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in postmortem 
      lung, kidney, and liver samples of patients who died with coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19) and its relationship with host factors involved in virus spread and 
      pathogenesis, using microscopy-based methods. The cases analyzed showed advanced 
      stages of diffuse acute alveolar damage and fibrosis. We identified the 
      SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (NC) in a variety of cells, colocalizing with 
      mitochondrial proteins, lipid droplets (LDs), and key host proteins that have 
      been implicated in inflammation, tissue repair, and the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle 
      (vimentin, NLRP3, fibronectin, LC3B, DDX3X, and PPARγ), pointing to vimentin and 
      LDs as platforms involved not only in the viral life cycle but also in 
      inflammation and pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a patient´s nasal swab 
      was grown in cell culture and used to infect hamsters. Target cells identified in 
      human tissue samples included lung epithelial and endothelial cells; lipogenic 
      fibroblast-like cells (FLCs) showing features of lipofibroblasts such as 
      activated PPARγ signaling and LDs; lung FLCs expressing fibronectin and vimentin 
      and macrophages, both with evidence of NLRP3- and IL1β-induced responses; 
      regulatory cells expressing immune-checkpoint proteins involved in lung repair 
      responses and contributing to inflammatory responses in the lung; CD34(+) liver 
      endothelial cells and hepatocytes expressing vimentin; renal interstitial cells; 
      and the juxtaglomerular apparatus. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may directly 
      interfere with critical lung, renal, and liver functions involved in 
      COVID-19-pathogenesis.

TI  - Stem cells and diabetic retinopathy: From models to treatment.
LID - 10.1007/s11033-023-08337-0 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a common yet complex microvascular disease, caused as a 
      complication of diabetes mellitus. Associated with hyperglycemia and subsequent 
      metabolic abnormalities, advanced stages of the disease lead to fibrosis, 
      subsequent visual impairment and blindness. Though clinical postmortems, animal 
      and cell models provide information about the progression and prognosis of 
      diabetic retinopathy, its underlying pathophysiology still needs a better 
      understanding. In addition to it, the loss of pericytes, immature retinal 
      angiogenesis and neuronal apoptosis portray the disease treatment to be 
      challenging. Indulged with cell loss of both vascular and neuronal type cells, 
      novel therapies like cell replacement strategies by various types of stem cells 
      have been sightseen as a possible treatment of the disease. This review provides 
      insight into the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy, current models used in 
      modelling the disease, as well as the varied aspects of stem cells in generating 
      three-dimensional retinal models. Further outlook on stem cell therapy and the 
      future directions of stem cell treatment in diabetic retinopathy have also been 
      contemplated.

TI  - Comparison of perioperative surgical outcomes following total robotic and total 
      laparoscopic Roux-en Y hepaticojejunostomy for choledochal cyst in paediatric 
      population: a preliminary report from a tertiary referral centre.
PG  - 139
LID - 10.1007/s00383-023-05414-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There is a paucity of data regarding the comparison of robotic and 
      laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) for the treatment of paediatric choledochal 
      cysts. Thus, our primary objective was a comparison of early complications namely 
      post-operative bleeding, anastomotic leak, intestinal obstruction and the need 
      for reoperation in both techniques. Our secondary objectives included a 
      comparison of the mean time for surgery and HJ, conversion of procedure to open, 
      intraoperative blood loss, late complications like cholangitis, stricture and 
      post-operative outcomes like time to start oral feeds and length of 
      post-operative stay. METHODS: A retrospective data analysis of all children who 
      underwent laparoscopic and robotic choledochal cyst excision with Roux-en-Y HJ 
      from 2008 to 2021 was performed. RESULTS: Ninety patients were classified into 
      Group R (robotic HJ), n = 20 and Group L (laparoscopic HJ), n = 70. 
      Post-operative complications were comparable amongst groups R and L (2 vs 6; 
      p = 1 and 1 vs 2, p = 0.53, respectively). Intraoperative blood loss was 
      significantly less in group R (54.8 ± 13.5 ml vs 64.1 ± 17.3 ml; p = 0.0280). The 
      mean time to complete HJ was significantly less in group R (58 ± 12 min vs 
      71 ± 11 min; p < 0.001) while the mean time to complete surgery was significantly 
      more in Group R (284 ± 14 min vs 195 ± 18 min; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our 
      preliminary research report suggests overall comparable early complications in 
      both groups.

TI  - A Cre-LoxP-based approach for combinatorial chromosome rearrangements in human 
      HAP1 cells.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1007/s10577-023-09719-7 [doi]
AB  - Alterations of human karyotype caused by chromosomal rearrangements are often 
      associated with considerable phenotypic effects. Studying molecular mechanisms 
      underlying these effects requires an efficient and scalable experimental model. 
      Here, we propose a Cre-LoxP-based approach for the generation of combinatorial 
      diversity of chromosomal rearrangements. We demonstrate that using the developed 
      system, both intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements can be induced in the 
      human haploid HAP1 cells, although the latter is significantly less effective. 
      The obtained genetically modified HAP1 cell line can be used to dissect genomic 
      effects associated with intra-chromosomal structural variations.

TI  - PD-1/PD-L1 blockade inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and improves 
      chemotherapeutic response in breast cancer.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1007/s12032-023-01965-3 [doi]
AB  - Therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have recently been implemented for triple 
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) management with limited efficacy, indicating that 
      this axis may promote tumor growth by means other than immune suppression. 
      Because PD-L1 overexpression causes resistance to the chemotherapeutic response 
      in many cancers, here we explored the tumor promoting role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis 
      in breast cancer. We observed that the downregulation of PD-L1 by specific siRNA 
      and pharmacological inhibitor significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation, 
      invasion and migration thereby enhancing T cell-mediated cell killing in vitro. 
      We also showed that inhibiting PD-L1 improves cytotoxic sensitivity to 
      chemotherapy in TNBC cells. Our in vivo results confirmed that combining a PD-L1 
      inhibitor with chemotherapy could significantly reduce tumor progression by 
      inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Overall, our results proved that 
      PD-L1 contributes to the transformation and progression of breast cancer cells 
      and that its intervention is a promising therapeutic strategy against breast 
      cancer.

TI  - Quality of life outcomes for patients with metastatic castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer and pretreatment prognostic score.
LID - 10.1002/pros.24503 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prognostic risk score (Halabi score) in metastatic 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) accurately predicts overall 
      survival, but its association with quality of life (QOL) has not been defined. We 
      hypothesize that a higher pretreatment Halabi score is associated with worse QOL 
      outcomes over time in mCRPC patients. METHODS: Patient-level data from the 
      docetaxel plus prednisone control arm of Mainsail, a Phase 3 clinical trial in 
      mCRPC were accessed via ProjectDataSphere. Pretreatment Halabi score included 
      disease-related factors: metastatic site, opioid use, Eastern Cooperative 
      Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS), alkaline phosphatase, albumin, 
      hemoglobin, lactic acid dehydrogenase, and PSA, with higher score indicating 
      worse survival. Three QOL scales were created: Functional Assessment of Cancer 
      Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P, higher score = better QOL), Brief Pain Inventory-Short 
      Form Severity score (BPI-SFSS, higher score = higher pain severity), and BPI-SF 
      Interference score (BPI-SFIS, higher score = greater pain interference). Mixed 
      linear model was used to estimate the associations between Halabi score and QOL 
      scores assessed at different time points (baseline, 2 months, and 6 months). 
      RESULTS: This analysis included 412 mCRPC patients (median age = 68 years, 82% 
      white, 5% Black, median log PSA = 4.4 ng/mL). After multivariable adjustment, 
      Halabi score was significantly associated with QOL scores at all time points. At 
      6 months, multivariable adjusted FACT-P decreased by 10.0 points (worsening), 
      BPI-SFSS increased by 0.8 points (worsening), and BPI-SFIS increased by 0.9 
      points (worsening) for each unit increase in Halabi risk score. In multivariable 
      analysis of individual components, ECOG-PS, site of metastasis, and opioid use 
      were significantly associated with worse QOL scores at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients with poorer Halabi prognostic risk scores have 
      poorer QOL and greater pain intensity and interference at baseline and during 
      follow-up.

TI  - Is Postextubation Dysphagia Underestimated in the Era of COVID-19? A Systematic 
      Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.1002/ohn.168 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence rate of postextubation dysphagia (PED) in 
      patients with COVID-19, as well as relative factors potentially influencing the 
      clinical course of dysphagia. DATA SOURCES: Six databases including PubMed, 
      MEDLINE, Embase, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science were searched with no restriction on the 
      language. REVIEW METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
      and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Data were extracted and 
      cross-examined among 3 of the authors. The random-effects model was adopted for 
      the statistical synthesis. The percentage and 95% confidence interval (CI) were 
      adopted as the effect measurements of the PED incidence rate. Subgroup analyses, 
      sensitivity analyses, and metaregression were also performed to identify the 
      heterogeneity among the studies. RESULTS: A total of 594 patients were enrolled 
      and analyzed from the 10 eligible studies. The weighted incidence of PED in 
      patients with COVID-19 was 66.5% (95% CI: 49.7%-79.9%). Age was the potential 
      factor influencing the incidence rate after heterogeneity was adjusted by the 
      metaregression analysis. CONCLUSION: Compared to the current evidence reporting 
      only 41% of the non-COVID patients experienced PED, our study further disclosed 
      that a higher 66.5% of COVID-19 patients suffered from PED, which deserves global 
      physicians' attention. With the association between COVID-19 and dysphagia having 
      been more clearly understood, future clinicians are suggested to identify 
      intubated patients' risk factors earlier to strengthen PED care programs in the 
      era of COVID-19.

TI  - Prospective role of 3βHSD1 in prostate cancer precision medicine.
LID - 10.1002/pros.24504 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is addicted to androgens. The steroidogenic enzyme 
      3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (3βHSD1) recognizes pregnenolone, 
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and steroidal medicine abiraterone as substrates 
      to accelerate disease progression. METHODS: References for this review were 
      identified through searches of PubMed with the search terms "prostate cancer", 
      "HSD3B1", and "3bHSD1" from 1990 until June, 2022. RESULTS: Genotype of 3βHSD1 
      has been reported to correlate with tumor aggressiveness of advanced prostate 
      cancer in multiple clinical scenarios. The ethnic differences and limitations of 
      using 3βHSD1 genotype as a prognostic biomarker have been discussed here. The 
      activity of 3βHSD1 increases in patients treated with abiraterone and 
      enzalutamide, giving rise to treatment resistance. Further elucidation of 3βHSD1 
      regulatory mechanisms will shed light on more approaches for disease 
      intervention. We also review the recent advance on 3βHSD1 inhibitors and 
      targeting 3βHSD1 for prostate cancer management. Novel 3βHSD1 inhibitors will be 
      needed to provide additional options for prostate cancer management. CONCLUSION: 
      3βHSD1 is both a predictive biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for 
      prostate cancer.

TI  - Monitoring of pulmonary involvement in critically ill COVID-19 patients - should 
      lung ultrasound be preferred over CT?

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear if relevant changes in pulmonary involvement in 
      critically ill COVID-19 patients can be reliably detected by the CT severity 
      score (CTSS) and lung ultrasound score (LUSS), or if these changes have 
      prognostic implications. In addition, it has been argued that adding pleural 
      abnormalities to the LUSS could improve its prognostic value. The objective of 
      this study was to compare LUSS and CTSS for the monitoring of COVID-19 pulmonary 
      involvement through: first, establishing the correlation of LUSS (± pleural 
      abnormalities) and CTSS throughout admission; second, assessing agreement and 
      measurement error between raters for LUSS, pleural abnormalities, and CTSS; 
      third, evaluating the association of the LUSS (± pleural abnormalities) and CTSS 
      with mortality at different timepoints. METHODS: This is a prospective, 
      observational study, conducted during the second COVID-19 wave at the 
      AmsterdamUMC, location VUmc. Adult COVID-19 ICU patients were prospectively 
      included when a CT or a 12-zone LUS was performed at admission or at weekly 
      intervals according to local protocol. Patients were followed 90 days or until 
      death. We calculated the: (1) Correlation of the LUSS (± pleural abnormalities) 
      and CTSS throughout admission with mixed models; (2) Intra-class correlation 
      coefficients (ICCs) and smallest detectable changes (SDCs) between raters; (3) 
      Association between the LUSS (± pleural abnormalities) and CTSS with mixed 
      models. RESULTS: 82 consecutive patients were included. Correlation between LUSS 
      and CTSS was 0.45 (95% CI 0.31-0.59). ICCs for LUSS, pleural abnormalities, and 
      CTSS were 0.88 (95% CI 0.73-0.95), 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.96), and 0.84 (95% CI 
      0.65-0.93), with SDCs of 4.8, 1.4, and 3.9. The LUSS was associated with 
      mortality in week 2, with a score difference between patients who survived or 
      died greater than its SDC. Addition of pleural abnormalities was not beneficial. 
      The CTSS was associated with mortality only in week 1, but with a score 
      difference less than its SDC. CONCLUSIONS: LUSS correlated with CTSS throughout 
      ICU admission but performed similar or better at agreement between raters and 
      mortality prognostication. Given the benefits of LUS over CT, it should be 
      preferred as initial monitoring tool.

TI  - The effect of interventions distributing home fortification products on infant 
      and young child feeding (IYCF) practices: A systematic narrative review.
PG  - e13488
LID - 10.1111/mcn.13488 [doi]
AB  - Interventions distributing micronutrient powders (MNPs) and small-quantity 
      lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS), or home fortification products (HFPs), 
      have the potential to improve infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices and 
      children's nutrition. We systematically searched for studies on the effect of 
      interventions distributing HFP on IYCF practices. We identified 12 (8 MNP, 
      4 SQ-LNS) studies: seven programmes with IYCF behaviour change communications 
      (BCC) and MNP (IYCF-MNP) and one provided MNP without IYCF BCC (MNP only). Three 
      SQ-LNS studies came from randomised trials without an IYCF component (SQ-LNS 
      only) and one from a programme with both IYCF BCC and SfQ-LNS (IYCF-SQ-LNS). Five 
      IYCF-MNP programmes reported positive associations with some IYCF practices-four 
      with minimum dietary diversity, two with minimum meal frequency, four with 
      minimum acceptable diet, and three with the initiation of complementary foods at 
      6 months. Two reported no association between MNP and IYCF indicators, and one 
      reported a decline in IYCF practices during the intervention, although it also 
      reported significant changes to the IYCF programme during the evaluation period. 
      Two studies from interventions that distributed SQ-LNS (one from a related set of 
      randomised controlled trials and the sole IYCF-SQ-LNS programme) reported a 
      positive association with IYCF practices; one trial reported no change in breast 
      milk intake with the provision of SQ-LNS and one found no association with IYCF 
      practices. SQ-LNS and MNP can address nutrient gaps for young children in 
      low-resource settings; our findings indicate that programmes that combine HFP 
      with IYCF interventions may also contribute to improved IYCF practices in some 
      settings.

TI  - Fathering and children's relational aggression: Moderating effects of children's 
      temperament and gender.
LID - 10.1002/ab.22078 [doi]
AB  - In this exploratory study, we analyzed the contribution of fathering to 
      relational aggression (RA) in middle childhood and the moderating role of 
      children's temperament and gender. Participants (N = 234; 46% girls) were 
      attending public elementary school (mean age = 8.15; SD = 1.23) in middle-class 
      neighborhoods in two Spanish cities. Fathers provided information about their 
      parenting practices using the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, 
      parents gave data on their child's temperament using the Temperament in Middle 
      Childhood Questionnaire and children provided information about their peers' 
      aggressive behavior using the Mini Direct Indirect Aggression Inventory. 
      Fathering dimensions considered were Authoritative Cold, Authoritative Warm, 
      Physical Punishment, and Insecurity; temperament dimensions considered were 
      negative affect (NA), effortful control (EC), activity (AC), and shyness (SH). 
      Gender, fathering, and temperament dimensions additively accounted for a 
      significant proportion of the variance observed in RA. Several significant 
      interactions suggested that the effect of fathering on RA was moderated by 
      temperament and, in some cases, by children's gender. NA increased the potential 
      risk of Authoritative Cold fathering (CF) and, in boys only, of Insecure 
      fathering, while EC potentiated the protective effect of Authoritative-Warm 
      fathering and, in boys only, buffered the risk effect of CF. SH buffered the risk 
      effect of CF and decreased the protective effect of Authoritative Warm fathering 
      on RA. Lastly, AC also buffered the risk effect of CF on RA. Results are 
      discussed in light of the protective or the vulnerability role of temperament and 
      in relation to models that explain sensitivity differences to environmental 
      contexts.

TI  - Relational model of relative deprivation, revenge, and 
      cyberbullying: A three-time longitudinal study.
LID - 10.1002/ab.22079 [doi]
AB  - Cyberbullying is a new form of aggression and can have serious consequences. 
      Although the influencing factors of cyberbullying have been explored in the 
      literature, less is known of the longitudinal effects of relative deprivation on 
      cyberbullying and the mediating mechanisms underlying the effect. In this study, 
      we explored these problems. A total of 1143 undergraduates (62.9% women, mean 
      age = 19.46, standard deviation [SD] = 0.95) participated in three rounds of a 
      longitudinal survey with an interval of 6 months and completed a series of 
      self-reported questionnaires assessing relative deprivation, revenge, and 
      cyberbullying. The results of random intercept cross-lagged panel model showed 
      that at between-person level, the random intercepts of relative deprivation, 
      revenge, and cyberbullying were positively associated with each other. At 
      within-person level, relative deprivation and revenge could predict each other 
      over time, and revenge longitudinally predicted cyberbullying. Moreover, revenge 
      mediated the longitudinal effect of relative deprivation on cyberbullying. The 
      results support and develop the view of the general aggression model and deepen 
      our understanding of the development mechanism of cyberbullying.

TI  - Gastric cancer-derived exosomes facilitate pulmonary metastasis by activating 
      ERK-mediated immunosuppressive macrophage polarization.
LID - 10.1002/jcb.30390 [doi]
AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) with pulmonary metastasis is one of the deadliest diseases in 
      the world; however, the underlying pathological mechanisms and potential 
      therapeutic targets remain to be elucidated. As exosomes play indispensable roles 
      in the formation of premetastatic niches (PMN) and cancer metastasis. Therefore, 
      investigating the underlying mechanisms of exosome-mediated pulmonary metastasis 
      of GC may shed new light on identifying novel therapeutic targets for GC 
      treatment. GC-derived exosomes were isolated from the conditioned medium of mouse 
      forestomach carcinoma (MFC) cell line. The effects of MFC-derived exosomes on 
      pulmonary macrophage polarization were analyzed by reverse- transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. Expression of PD-L1 and other 
      proteins was evaluated by Western blot. Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) were analyzed 
      by microarray. GC-derived exosomes (GC-exo) accumulated in high numbers in the 
      lungs and were ingested by macrophages. The extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 
      (ERK) signaling pathway was activated by GC-exo, inducing macrophage 
      immunosuppressive-phenotype differentiation and increased PD-L1 expression. 
      miRNA-sequencing identified 130 enriched miRNAs in GC-exo. Among the enriched 
      miRNAs, miR-92a-3p plays a major role in activating ERK signaling via inhibition 
      of PTEN expression. In addition, inhibiting ERK signaling with PD98059 
      significantly reduced the expression of PD-L1 in macrophages and, therefore, 
      reversed the immunosuppressive PMN and inhibited the colonization of GC cells in 
      the lungs. This study identified a novel mechanism of GC-exo mediated PD-L1 
      expression in lung macrophages that facilitates lung PMN formation and GC 
      pulmonary metastasis, which also provided a potential therapeutic target for GC 
      with pulmonary metastasis treatment.

TI  - Endoscopic management of buried bumper syndrome using the Balloon Dilation Pull 
      (BDP) technique: a multicenter analysis.
PG  - 5-9
LID - 10.51821/86.1.11005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Buried bumper syndrome (BBS) may complicate 
      percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. In these patients, endoscopic 
      treatment ought to be considered. Various approaches have been published, ranging 
      from dissectionbased techniques to novel dedicated devices, although the evidence 
      supporting the use of the Balloon Dilation Pull (BDP) technique has been limited 
      to single case reports. The aim of this paper is to assess the feasibility, 
      efficacy and safety of the systematic use of the BDPtechnique for the endoscopic 
      treatment of BBS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter 
      analysis of prospectively collected data from all patients treated with the 
      BDP-technique between January 2011 and November 2021. RESULTS: In total, 26 
      patients were identified (median age 72 (SD ± 13) years, 74% male, 84.6% 
      underlying neurological disease). Technical success was achieved in 92.3%, with a 
      median procedure time of 17.5 minutes (range 5-27). Adverse events were 
      identified in 3.8% of patients (N=1, aspiration, ASGE lexicon severity grade: 
      moderate). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that the BDP-technique is highly 
      efficacious and safe, using accessories readily available in every endoscopic 
      unit. Given the limited procedure time and tools required, this procedure has the 
      potential to further optimize patient care in the context of BBS.

TI  - Driving performance of outpatients achieving discharge criteria after deep 
      sedation is worse than these of their escort-driver: a prospective observational 
      study on simulator.
PG  - 11-16
LID - 10.51821/86.1.11090 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Achieving post-anesthesia discharge criteria after surgery or 
      outpatient procedures does not mean that the patient has regained all his or her 
      faculties, such as driving. Although mandated by many clinical guidelines, there 
      is no evidence that escort-drivers reduce the risk of traffic accidents after 
      deep sedation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate that hypothesis that 
      driving performance as measured using a driving simulation would not differ 
      between patients who had undergone deep sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy 
      meeting discharge criteria and their escorts. METHODS: This prospective study 
      included patients scheduled for ambulatory gastrointestinal endoscopy under deep 
      propofol sedation (patient group) and their escorts (escort group). Driving 
      performance of escorts and patients (when discharge criteria were met) was 
      assessed using a driving simulator. RESULTS: 30 patients and their escorts were 
      included. Patients crossed the midline significantly more frequently than escorts 
      (3 [2-4] (median [IQR]) and 2 [1-3] crossings, respectively, p=0.015]. Patients 
      were speeding for a higher proportion of the distance traveled compared with 
      escorts (37 (20)% (mean (SD)) and 24 (17)% in patients and escorts, respectively, 
      p = 0.029). There were no significant differences between groups in other 
      simulation parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to stay within the traffic lanes, 
      as measured by the number of midline crossing during a simulated driving 
      performance, is impaired in patients who meet discharge criteria after 
      gastrointestinal endoscopy under deep sedation compared with their escorts. This 
      finding does not support a practice of allowing patients to drive themselves home 
      after these procedures.

TI  - Epidemiological characteristics of a population visiting a patient-centered 
      informative website about irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 17-25
LID - 10.51821/86.1.10885 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder 
      characterized by abdominal pain and an altered bowel habit. The aim of this study 
      was to evaluate the characteristics of a population visiting a patient-centered 
      informative website about IBS. METHODS: Five digital surveys were used to assess 
      the Rome IV criteria, red flag symptoms, healthcare use, psychological 
      comorbidities, quality of life, symptom severity, diet, physical activity. 
      Patients were divided into a Rome positive and negative population with the Rome 
      positive population being further subtyped based on dominant stool pattern. 
      RESULTS: Red flag symptoms (42%) and comorbid psychological disorders (65% 
      anxiety and 39% depression) were common. Despite consulting health care 
      professionals and therapy, most patients (96%) still experienced moderate to 
      severe symptoms with an average impact on quality of life. 73% performed regular 
      physical exercise and 25% of the Rome positive population followed the FODMAP 
      diet. Almost all participants consulted a health care professional at one point 
      in time and used some form of therapy. 54% of the patients believed there is 
      generally sufficient information available and 57% thinks that their physician 
      takes IBS seriously. However, only 41% thinks that their physician has sufficient 
      knowledge about IBS. CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines the importance of a 
      thorough characterization of IBS patients. Furthermore, patients expressed an 
      urgent need for high quality information and education for both health care 
      professionals and patients.

TI  - Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage for distal malignant biliary 
      obstruction: a prospective 3-year multicenter Egyptian study.
PG  - 26-35
LID - 10.51821/86.1.10828 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) is often diagnosed at late 
      stages with mostly unresectable lesions. Recently, EUS-guided biliary drainage 
      (EUS-BD) has gained wide acceptance and appears to be a feasible and safe backup 
      option after ERCP failure in such patients. Herein, we aimed to represent a 
      3-year multi-center Egyptian experience in the application of this challenging 
      procedure for distal MBO as a salvage technique after failed ERCP. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: This was a prospective multi-center study of patients underwent EUS-BD 
      for distal MBO in the duration between December 2018 and December 2021, after 
      ERCP failure. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients (59 males, median age: 61 years) were 
      included in the study. EUS-guided extrahepatic approach including 
      choledocho-duodenostomy (CDS) was done for 48 patients (52.8%), followed by 
      choledecho-antrostomy (CAS) in 4 patients (4.4%). The intrahepatic approach 
      included hepaticogastrostomy (HGS) for 35 patients (38.5%) and antegrade stenting 
      (AG) stenting in 2 patients (2.2%), while Rendezvous (RV) approach was performed 
      in 2 patients (2.2%). Technical and Clinical success were achieved in the 
      majority of cases; 93.4% and 94.1% respectively. Adverse events occurred in 13.2% 
      of patients which were mostly mild (8.2%) to moderate (2.4%). Only one patient 
      died within 48h after the procedure with progression of preceding sepsis and 
      organ failure. CONCLUSION: EUS-BD is a feasible option, even in developing 
      countries, after a failed ERCP, and it is a relatively safe option in patients 
      with MBO once experienced team and resources were present. Majority of cases in 
      our study have achieved technical and clinical success with relatively low 
      incidence of adverse events.

TI  - Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection: a review on patient selection and 
      indications.
PG  - 36-46
LID - 10.51821/86.1.10856 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of 'third-space'-endoscopy has paved the way towards 
      en-bloc resection of early gastrointestinal neoplasia. Endoscopic submucosal 
      dissection (ESD) has improved the endoscopic management of colorectal lesions by 
      facilitating R0-resection, improving histological assessment and preventing 
      recurrence. METHODS: The purpose of this review is to provide an evidence-based 
      overview of indications for which ESD should be considered within colorectal 
      endoscopy. RESULTS: The development of ESD has partially bridged the gap between 
      endoscopy and surgery, but depends heavily on adequate pre-resection visual 
      evaluation, ruling out potential deep submucosal invasion. ESD should be 
      considered for large colorectal polyps (≥20mm) and/or lesions diagnosed as 
      harbouring high-grade dysplasia, in-situ carcinoma or superficial submucosal 
      invasion. Not only has it found its way into our guidelines for the treatment of 
      neuroendocrine neoplasms, ESD also seems a promising alternative for the 
      controlled resection of large pedunculated lesions. ESD can also be applied in 
      more challenging situations, such as in pre-treated lesions, post-surgical 
      context and in patients with IBD, although this requires a high level of skill 
      and expertise. CONCLUSIONS: In this review we have described the different 
      indications for ESD and attempted to define its place within our current 
      endoscopic armamentarium. For both non-expert and expert endoscopists, knowledge 
      about ESD indications, patient selection and therapeutic alternatives, remains 
      crucial in the care for patients with colorectal neoplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Functional dyspepsia is a common chronic condition 
      with upper abdominal symptoms in the absence of an organic cause. The first line 
      treatment consists of protonpomp inhibition or Helicobacter pylori eradication. 
      However, this approach often does not provide enough symptom relief. 
      Neuromodulating agents are commonly used in clinical practice but only tricyclic 
      antidepressant (TCAs) are mentioned in European and American and Canadian 
      guidelines. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature in 
      Pubmed for full-text randomized controlled trials in English with adult 
      participants (>18 years) who met the Rome II, III or IV criteria or were 
      diagnosed by a physician with a negative upper endoscopy and that compared a 
      neuromodulating agent with placebo. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 386 
      articles of which 14 articles met the eligibility criteria. TCAs like 
      amitriptyline and imipramine have been shown to be effective in the treatment of 
      functional dyspepsia whereas other neuromodulating agents like tetracyclic 
      antidepressants, levosulpiride and anxiolytics might be beneficial but conclusive 
      evidence is lacking. serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) and 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have not shown benefit in patients 
      with functional dyspepsia. CONCLUSION: Selected neuromodulators have an 
      established efficacy in functional dyspepsia. The best supporting evidence is 
      available for TCAs with a potential role for tetracyclic antidepressants, 
      levosulpiride and anxiolytics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) are indices 
      used to assess arterial stiffness. We aim to compare the effect of empagliflozin, 
      liraglutide and their sequential combination on arterial stiffness indices in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: This was a randomized single blind 
      study evaluating the effect of empagliflozin vs liraglutide in adult patients 
      with T2D. Patients were randomized to liraglutide titrated gradually to 1.8 mg or 
      empagliflozin 25 mg in 1:1 ratio. Three months later empagliflozin was added to 
      the liraglutide group, and liraglutide was added to the empagliflozin group. 
      Patients were assessed with non-invasive tests for arterial stiffness (i.e., 
      carotid-femoral PWV and AIx of aortic pressure) at baseline, 3-month and 9-month 
      visits (final visit was extended for 3 months from the initial design due to 
      Covid 19 pandemic). The primary outcome was the between-group difference of PWV 
      change (ΔPWV) and ΔAIx at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included the between-group 
      difference of ΔPWV and ΔAIx at 9 months, as well as the ΔPWV and ΔAIx between 
      baseline and 9-month visit when total study population was assessed. RESULTS: A 
      total of 62 patients with T2D (30 started liraglutide; 32 empagliflozin, mean age 
      63 years, 25 % with established cardiovascular disease) participated in the 
      study. We failed to show any significant between-group differences of ΔPWV and 
      ΔΑΙx at 3 and 9 months, as well as between-group difference of ΔPWV and ΔAIx for 
      the total study population between baseline and 9-month visit. In contrast, 
      systemic vascular resistance and lipoprotein(a) levels improved, showing better 
      results with liraglutide than empagliflozin. Favorable effects were also observed 
      on body weight, body mass index, body and visceral fat, blood pressure, HbA1c, 
      and uric acid levels. CONCLUSION: No evidence of a favorable change in arterial 
      stiffness indices was seen with empagliflozin or liraglutide or their combination 
      in this study. Well-designed powerful studies are needed to address any potential 
      effects on arterial stiffness in selected populations.

AB  - Cancer panel sequencing has been rapidly adopted into clinical practice for the 
      detection of actionable genetic variants in advanced non-small cell lung 
      carcinomas. Unexpected molecular results may lead to reexamination of the 
      clinical diagnosis; however, this scenario has not been systematically evaluated. 
      We reviewed cancer panel next-generation sequencing results from 1007 consecutive 
      patients performed for the clinical indication of non-small cell lung carcinoma 
      along with the corresponding clinical history and anatomical pathology findings. 
      The final integrative diagnosis was a cancer of extrapulmonary origin in 12 of 
      1007 patients (1.2%). Molecular evidence supporting the final diagnoses included 
      the detection of an UV radiation-associated mutational signature (n = 6), gene 
      fusions (n = 2), and mutations (n = 4). The integrative diagnoses included 
      undifferentiated melanoma, cutaneous squamous cell, and basal cell carcinomas, 
      thyroid carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic 
      adenocarcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and synovial sarcoma. A small 
      but nonnegligible proportion of clinically suspected non-small cell lung 
      carcinomas had a final diagnosis of cancer of extrapulmonary origin after 
      clinical next-generation sequencing. The integration of clinical, microscopic, 
      and molecular evidence can aid diagnosis and guide personalized oncology care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of misoprostol as a 
      treatment option for incomplete abortion in secondary hospitals in Yangon and 
      Mandalay, Myanmar. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed methods study was 
      conducted. Women seeking treatment for an incomplete abortion with a uterine size 
      <12 weeks were eligible to participate in the prospective cohort including 
      sublingual administration of 400 μg misoprostol, clinical assessment 7-10 days 
      after administration, and patient interview. Treatment efficacy was assessed, 
      defined as proportion of participants with complete uterine evacuation with 
      misoprostol alone. After the cohort, provider interviews were conducted to 
      understand how their experiences with misoprostol may have influenced cohort 
      findings. Study sites included seventeen secondary health facilities in four 
      townships in Yangon and Mandalay, Myanmar. RESULTS: A total of 110 women were 
      enrolled from July 2018 to January 2019; 96 completed follow-up. In 75 % of 
      cases, incomplete abortion was successfully treated with misoprostol. Treatment 
      efficacy varied significantly by region (Yangon 85 %, Mandalay 67 %; p = 0.048), 
      driven by providers' variable comfort with misoprostol and proclivity to 
      intervene with additional treatment. With experience, all were willing to 
      incorporate the protocol into practice by study end. Patient acceptability and 
      satisfaction were high. CONCLUSION: Misoprostol is an acceptable and feasible 
      treatment option for women seeking postabortion care at secondary facilities in 
      Myanmar. Extensive health provider training and support systems and continued 
      implementation experience are crucial to effectively translate clinical PAC 
      guidelines into practice in Myanmar.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the different sources used by individuals 
      when seeking fertility information in order to understand what's working, what 
      isn't, and opportunities for improvement. METHODS: A mixed-method study was 
      conducted via UK-wide cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews. 1082 
      survey-participants were recruited nationwide via online-newspaper and 
      social-media adverts. Of those who agreed to follow-up interview, 35 were 
      purposively sampled to reflect the diversity of gender, age-range, ethnicity and 
      education. Tableau software was used for surveys and NVIVO for interviews. 
      Interview data was transcribed and analysed via thematic framework analysis. 
      RESULTS: Sources of information identified included: school-education; 
      healthcare-professionals; internet, social-media, smartphone-apps, online-forums 
      and blogs; family, friends, and communities; books, magazines, newspapers; 
      fertility-products; workplace, communities and sexual-health clinics/centres, 
      charities, and third-party organisations. Participants reported varying levels of 
      access, reliability, and trust, in relation to these sources. Interview themes 
      around veracity showed that healthcare-professionals were highly trusted but not 
      easily accessible. The internet was very popular due to accessibility and 
      perceived anonymity but untrusted, and "the plethora of information can be 
      overwhelming." There were recurring themes around discomfort. A respondent 
      recalled that her first discussion of sex with her mother was on her wedding 
      night stating, "…Mum, I'm 28! And you're just discussing this with me now?" 
      CONCLUSIONS: School education remains a consistent but sometimes inadequate 
      source of fertility information. In addition to online-platforms and products 
      based on robust scientific evidence, opportunities for improvement include using 
      underexploited sources, such as workplace and community settings, with training 
      for providers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Growing cannabis legalization has coincided with an increased focus 
      on use of both alcohol and cannabis (AC co-use) among younger people; however, 
      little is known about AC co-use among adults over age 30. This study examines the 
      prevalence of different types of AC co-use among adults, as well as compares AC 
      co-users and alcohol-only users on individual, social network, and neighborhood 
      characteristics. METHODS: Data come from three annual surveys of a nationally 
      representative sample of 1,770 U.S. adults, initially between the ages of 30-80, 
      conducted between 2019 and 2021. The baseline sample is 52.8 years old on 
      average, 51.8 % female, and 60.1 % non-Hispanic White. RESULTS: Past month co-use 
      at baseline was reported by 8.4% of adults, and mostly consisted of simultaneous 
      use, with less than 5% of the sample initiating co-use over the two-year 
      follow-up period. Multivariable models indicate AC co-use was cross-sectionally 
      associated with respondents being male, younger, Hispanic (vs White), and having 
      more alcohol use and related problems, and with their social network composition 
      (e.g., having more drinking buddies and cannabis users in the network). However, 
      co-use status was not associated with mental health, physical ailments, or 
      neighborhood quality. Longitudinal analyses indicated that AC co-use at baseline 
      predicted more alcohol use one year later and alcohol related problems two years 
      later among men only. CONCLUSIONS: AC co-use among adults over age 30 deserves 
      further attention given its prevalence and associations with heavier drinking and 
      related problems. Network-focused interventions may be a promising approach for 
      reducing AC co-use.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Histolog® Scanner (SamanTree Medical SA, Lausanne, Switzerland) is a 
      large field-of-view confocal laser scanning microscope designed to allow 
      intraoperative margin assessment by the production of histological images ready 
      for assessment in the operating room. We evaluated the feasibility and the 
      performance of the Histolog® Scanner (HS) to correctly identify infiltrated 
      margins in clinical practice of lumpectomy specimens. It was extrapolated if the 
      utilization of the HS has the potential to reduce infiltrated margins and 
      therefore reduce re-operation rates in patients undergoing breast conserving 
      surgery (BCS) due to a primarily diagnosed breast cancer including ductal 
      carcinoma in situ. METHODS: This is a single-center, prospective, 
      non-interventional, diagnostic pilot study including 50 consecutive patients 
      receiving BCS. The complete surface of the specimen was scanned using the HS 
      intraoperatively. The surgery and the intraoperative margin assessment of the 
      specimen was performed according to the clinical routine consisting of 
      conventional specimen radiography as well as the clinical impression of the 
      surgeon. Three surgeons and an experienced pathologist assessed the scans 
      produced by the HS for cancer cells on the surface. The potential of the HS to 
      correctly identify involved margins was compared to the results of the 
      conventional specimen radiography alone as well as the clinical routine. The 
      histopathological report served as the gold standard. RESULTS: 50 specimens 
      corresponding to 300 surfaces were scanned by the HS. The mean sensitivity of the 
      surgeons to identify involved margins with the HS was 37.5% ± 5.6%, the 
      specificity was 75.2% ± 13.0%. The assessment of resection margins by the 
      pathologist resulted in a sensitivity of 37.5% and a specificity of 81.0%, while 
      the local clinical routine resulted in a sensitivity of 37.5% and a specificity 
      of 78.2%. CONCLUSION: Acquisition of high-resolution histological images using 
      the HS was feasible in clinical practice. Sensitivity and specificity were 
      comparable to clinical routine. With more specific training and experience on 
      image interpretation and acquisition, the HS may have the potential to enable 
      more accuracy in the margin assessment of BCS specimens.

AB  - In this review, we evaluate the potential and recent advancements in using 
      artificial intelligence techniques to de-escalate loco-regional breast cancer 
      therapy, with a special focus on surgical treatment after neoadjuvant systemic 
      treatment (NAST). The increasing use and efficacy of NAST make the optimal 
      loco-regional management of patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) a 
      clinically relevant knowledge gap. It is hypothesized that patients with pCR do 
      not benefit from therapeutic surgery because all tumor has already been 
      eradicated by NAST. It is unclear, however, how residual cancer after NAST can be 
      reliably excluded prior to surgery to identify patients eligible for omitting 
      breast cancer surgery. Evidence from clinical trials evaluating the potential of 
      imaging and minimally-invasive biopsies to exclude residual cancer suggests that 
      there is a high risk of missing residual cancer. More recently, AI-based 
      algorithms have shown promising results to reliably exclude residual cancer after 
      NAST. This example illustrates the great potential of AI-based algorithms to 
      further de-escalate and individualize loco-regional breast cancer treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the distribution and the trend of airborne particles and 
      bio-aerosol concentration in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in two 
      tertiary care hospitals with different ventilation setting. METHODS: Hospitals A 
      but not B is provided with a central HEPA filter. PICUs in both hospitals were 
      categorized into protective environment (PE) with room HEPA filter, 
      semi-protective environment (SPE) with portable air-purifier, and non-protective 
      environment (NPE) with neither system. Fine particles (≤ 2.5 µm) and coarse 
      particles (≤ 10.0 µm) were obtained using optical particle counter (Lighthouse 
      Handheld 3016) and total bacterial (TBC) and fungal (TFC) counts were obtained 
      using Andersen air sampler. RESULTS: Hospital B had significantly higher levels 
      of fine and coarse particles (in all room), TBC (in PE), but not TFC compared 
      with matched rooms in hospital A. In hospital B, the levels of fine particles, 
      coarse particles, and TBC were lowest in SPE (p < 0.001, p = 0.004, and 
      p = 0.006, respectively) while TFC was lowest in NPE (p = 0.014). Airborne 
      particles, TBC, and TFC had variable trends with some of the indoor peaks follow 
      outdoor peaks. Gram-positive bacteria (69 %) were the predominant bacteria in 
      hospital A while bacterial flora (70 %) were the predominant bacteria in hospital 
      B (p < 0.001 for each). CONCLUSIONS: The levels of airborne contaminants and 
      microbial counts in PICUs are significantly affected by the ventilation system 
      and to less extent by outdoor levels. The results indicated that advanced 
      filtration system and central HEPA filters play a significant role in the 
      reduction of indoor fine particulates and TBC.

AB  - PURPOSE: Post acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection are defined by persistence 
      or re-occurrence of symptoms six to 12 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infections. 
      METHODS: Twice vaccinated hospital employees after mild to moderate 
      post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection completed a questionnaire on the incidence 
      of general, respiratory, neuropsychiatric, dermatological and gastrointestinal 
      symptoms, experienced during their acute infection and eight weeks after 
      recovery. Post acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection were analysed in relation 
      to socio-demographic-, health-, virus- and acute infection-related 
      characteristics. RESULTS: 73 participants, 25 women and 48 men with a mean age of 
      40.9 years, with a post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection completed the survey. 
      Out of these 93 % reported at least one symptom at time of initial SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, 31.5 %, predominantly women, reported post acute sequelae at least 
      eight weeks after the acute infection stage. Fatigue, dysgeusia and dysosmia, 
      headache or difficulty concentrating and shortness of breath during acute 
      infection, BMI> 25 and pre-existing pulmonary disorders were associated with post 
      acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants with initially more than 
      five symptoms were four times more likely to report post acute sequelae. 
      CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the multiplicity of symptoms during acute 
      SARS-CoV-2 infections increases the risk for post acute symptoms.

AB  - The Brazilian Amazon rainforest region has a significant prevalence of malarial 
      and intestinal parasitic infections in indigenous populations, accounting for a 
      disproportionate burden. Thus, a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess 
      the prevalence and association between malarial and intestinal protozoan and 
      helminth infections in four remote indigenous villages in the Brazilian Amazon 
      Forest. A total of 430 individuals participated in the study, and Plasmodium 
      infections were diagnosed by examination of thick blood smears and PCR. Stool 
      samples 295 individuals (69%) were examined by direct smear and the Kato-Katz 
      technique. The overall prevalence of malaria, intestinal protozoan infection, and 
      intestinal helminth infection was 14.2%, 100%, and 39.3%, respectively. 
      Polyparasitism was predominant (83.7%), and most infected individuals had at 
      least two or more different species of intestinal protozoan and/or helminth 
      parasites. The prevalence of co-infection was 49.5%, and in individuals with 
      intestinal protozoa and helminth infections (34%), Entamoeba. coli, Entamoeba 
      histolytica, and Ascaris lumbricoides were the most common parasites. In 
      individuals with malaria and protozoa infections (10.2%), P. vivax, E. coli, and 
      E. histolytica predominated, and in individuals with malaria, protozoa, and 
      helminth infections (5.4%). P. vivax, E. coli, E. histolytica, and A. 
      lumbricoides predominated. Intestinal polyparasitism was common in the study 
      population, and the presence of helminths was associated with an increased number 
      of intestinal parasitic species. However, Plasmodium infections were neither a 
      risk nor a protective factor for helminth infections; the same was true for 
      helminth infections in relation to Plasmodium. The high prevalence of intestinal 
      polyparasitism with Plasmodium co-infections highlights the need for combining 
      strategies that may help control both malaria and intestinal parasite and 
      generate a health approach aligned with indigenous perspectives.

TI  - Practice patterns for initial management of oral leukoplakia amongst 
      otolaryngologists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral leukoplakia is encountered frequently by otolaryngologists and 
      oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS). There are no consensus practice 
      management guidelines for oral leukoplakia, resulting in heterogeneity in 
      practice patterns. Characterization of practice patterns of providers who treat 
      oral leukoplakia will be valuable to establish standards of care and future 
      practice guidelines. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey was designed by the American 
      Head and Neck Society Cancer Prevention Service collecting demographic and 
      practice management data for treating oral leukoplakia. The survey was approved 
      and distributed to members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and 
      Neck Surgery and American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Data 
      analysis was performed using chi square and t-test where appropriate. RESULTS: 
      396 responses were collected: 83 OMFS, 81 head and neck fellowship-trained 
      providers, and 232 otolaryngologists (non-head and neck fellowship-trained). 
      Providers saw a wide volume of oral leukoplakia (23.0% >30 cases/year, 35.1% 
      11-30 cases/year, 41.2% 10 or less cases/year), with OMFS seeing more cases of 
      oral leukoplakia. Factors most associated with consideration of initial biopsy 
      included physical exam findings (94.4%), erythroplakia (82.3%), and smoking 
      status (81.6%). The majority of respondents saw patients in follow-up within 
      1 month (24.8%) or within 1-3 months (46.5%). CONCLUSION: This survey identifies 
      a range of practice patterns in initial management of oral leukoplakia, including 
      indications for biopsy, and time for follow-up. This data provide insight into 
      practice patterns amongst different groups of providers and can potentially lead 
      to consensus guidelines for initial management of oral leukoplakia.

AB  - There are concerns that the innovation of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant 
      (GMHT) plants, as well as the application of herbicide to such GMHT plants, could 
      have an impact on ecological interactions and unintentionally harm non-targeted 
      organisms. Consequently, we intend to use full-length 16 S rDNA amplicon 
      sequencing to examine changes in the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of 
      GMHT soybean (Z106) harboring 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase and 
      Glyphosate N-acetyltransferase genes and GMHT soybean treated with glyphosate 
      (Z106G). Glyphosate application significantly impacted bacterial alpha diversity 
      (species richness, and Shannon diversity). Permutational multivariate analysis of 
      variance of beta diversity demonstrated that soil compartments and growth stages 
      had a substantial impact on soybean rhizobacterial communities (soil 
      compartments, growth stages, P = 0.001). Community composition revealed that 
      Z106G soils were abundant in Taibaiella and Arthrobacter pascens at maturity, 
      while Chryseobacterium joostei and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia predominated in 
      Z106 soils during flowering. Nitrogen-fixing and phosphate-solubilizing microbes 
      were found in higher proportions in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil, with 
      Sinorhizobium being more abundant in Z106 and Bacillus and Stenotrophomonas being 
      more prevalent in Z106G rhizosphere soils. Collectively, our findings suggest 
      glyphosate application and glyphosate-tolerant soybean as potential regulators of 
      soybean rhizobacterial composition.

AB  - Soil aggregates (SAs) are the main site for soil organic carbon (SOC) fixation, 
      and land plastic pollution is increasingly causing many soil problems. The 
      effects of plastic on SAs and SOC seem to be significant, but there is still a 
      lack of relevant research. This study investigated the effects of the "plastic 
      contamination layer" (PCL) formed by the microplastic precursors (namely, 
      oversized microplastics (OMPs)) on the content and properties of SAs of different 
      particle sizes at different soil depths. The results showed that the PCL had an 
      effect on SAs of different sizes at different depths: Compared with the control 
      group, PCL mainly increased the content of SAs in 0-5 cm soil depth, about 
      28.08 mg macroaggregates, 13.79 mg microaggregates and 59.82 mg silt and clay 
      aggregates per gram of soil. The presence of the PCL mainly down-regulates the 
      organic carbon (OC) content in 0-5 cm macroaggregates, which is about 9.59 g/kg, 
      the OC content in 10-20 cm microaggregates, which is about 16.41 g/kg, and the OC 
      content in 0-5 cm silt and clay aggregates, which is about 4.16 g /kg, 
      downregulated the expression of the key carbon metabolism genes (CMGs) coxL, and 
      inhibited the contribution of the potential CMGs host bacteria Sphaerimonospora 
      and Bacteroides to soil organic matter. This paper emphasizes that the presence 
      of PCL reduced SOC sequestration.

AB  - Microbial colonization on microplastics has provoked global concern; however, 
      many studies have not considered the successional patterns and potential roles of 
      abundant and rare taxa of the plastisphere during colonization. Hence, we 
      investigate the taxonomic composition, assembly, interaction and function of 
      abundant and rare taxa in the riverine plastisphere by conducting microcosm 
      experiments. Results showed that rare taxa occupied significantly high community 
      diversity and niche breadth than the abundant taxa, which implies that rare taxa 
      are essential components in maintaining the community stability of the 
      plastisphere. However, the abundant taxa played a major role in driving the 
      succession of plastisphere communities during colonization. Both stochastic and 
      deterministic processes signally affected the plastisphere community assemblies; 
      while, the deterministic patterns (heterogeneous selection) were especially 
      pronounced for rare biospheres. Plastisphere microbial networks were shaped by 
      the enhancement of network modularity and reinforcement of positive interactions. 
      Rare taxa played critical roles in shaping stable plastisphere by occupying the 
      key status in microbial networks. The strong interaction of rare and non-rare 
      taxa suggested that multi-species collaboration might be conducive to the 
      formation and stability of the plastisphere. Both abundant and rare taxa were 
      enriched with plentiful functional genes related to carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus 
      and sulfur cycling; however, their potential metabolic functions were 
      significantly discrepant, implying that the abundant and rare microbes may play 
      different roles in ecosystems. Overall, this study strengthens our comprehending 
      of the mechanisms regarding the formation and maintenance of the plastisphere.

AB  - Medicinal plants have a wide range of uses worldwide. However, the quality of 
      medicinal plants is affected by severe cadmium pollution. Cadmium can reduce 
      photosynthetic capacity, lead to plant growth retardation and oxidative stress, 
      and affect secondary metabolism. Medicinal plants have complex mechanisms to cope 
      with cadmium stress. On the one hand, an antioxidant system can effectively 
      scavenge excess reactive oxygen species produced by cadmium stress. On the other 
      hand, cadmium chelates are formed by chelating peptides and then sequestered 
      through vacuolar compartmentalization. Cadmium has no specific transporter in 
      plants and is generally transferred to plant tissues through competition for the 
      transporters of divalent metal ions, such as zinc, iron, and manganese. In recent 
      years, progress has been achieved in exploring the physiological mechanisms by 
      which medicinal plants responding to cadmium stress. The exogenous regulation of 
      cadmium accumulation in medicinal plants has been studied, and the aim is 
      reducing the toxicity of cadmium. However, research into molecular mechanisms is 
      still lagging. In this paper, we review the physiological and molecular 
      mechanisms and regulatory networks of medicinal plants exposed to cadmium, 
      providing a reference for the study on the responses of medicinal plants to 
      cadmium stress.

AB  - Tisotumab vedotin (TV) is an antibody-drug conjugate used for the treatment of 
      adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. TV comprised of a 
      monoclonal antibody against tissue factor and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a 
      potent inhibitor of cell division. The innovaTV-201 and 
      innovaTV-204/GO30xx/ENGOT-cx6 trials showed that TV has clinically meaningful and 
      durable antitumor activity in pretreated patients with recurrent or metastatic 
      cervical cancer. The innovaTV-204 trial showed that TV monotherapy resulted in an 
      objective response rate of 24% (including 7% and 17% complete and partial 
      responses, respectively). In September 2021, the US Food and Drugs Administration 
      (FDA) granted accelerated approval to TV for the treatment of recurrent or 
      metastatic cervical cancer patients with disease progression on or after 
      chemotherapy. The ongoing randomized, open-label Phase 3 
      innovaTV-301/ENGOTcx12/GOG-30xx trial will assess the effect of TV in pre-treated 
      recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Meanwhile, the phase 1b/2 trial ENGOT 
      Cx8/GOG 3024/innovaTV-205 is testing other possible combination between TV and 
      other treatments. TV is characterized by a promising antitumor activity and an 
      acceptable safety profile. Moreover, the preliminary data highlighted the 
      feasibility of using TV in first line. In the first line, TV in combination with 
      carboplatin or pembrolizumab provides an ORR of 55% and 41%, respectively 
      Although the effect of adding TV to the current standard of care in first-line 
      (carboplatin plus pembrolizumab) is still under evaluation, we expected to 
      observe impressive results in the cervical cancer population.

AB  - Redox species in wine are altered by pH and some wines are easily degraded due to 
      oxidation and sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) reduction. There is a need for quick, easy, 
      simple, and economical methodologies for pH and wine-oxidized products 
      (acetaldehyde) analysis. This study aimed to measure pH and degradation of wines 
      that were electrochemically analyzed using polyaniline (PANI) sensor. Gas 
      chromatography (GC) and fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) were also 
      used. Electrochemical analysis showed that oxidation was accelerated and peak 
      currents (I(p,a)) and potentials (E(p,a)) shifted to negative direction due to 
      acetaldehyde formation. PANI sensor achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 
      7 × 10(-1) ppm and a sensitivity of 5.20 µA ppm(-1) cm(-2). Acetaldehyde 
      formation was confirmed by GC (30%) and FT-IR spectra at 1647 cm(-1) to the CO 
      vibration of aldehyde. These results suggested that acetaldehyde degraded the 
      taste of wine after remaining open.

AB  - The ultrasound-induced impacts on the peptide characteristics and taste of 
      unsmoked bacon have been evaluated through the use of peptidomics and 
      bioinformatics approaches. Furthermore, the effect of such ultrasound-induced 
      changes on the main endogenous proteases responsible for peptide generation was 
      also investigated. In fact, the activity of main endogenous proteases was 
      significantly increased after ultrasonic treatment during the processing of 
      unsmoked bacon, and contributed to an increased number and an enhanced LFQ 
      intensity of peptides. Besides, such increased amount of peptides and LFQ 
      intensity with up to 500 W ultrasonic treatment were beneficial for the taste 
      improvement of the final products as shown by taste prediction analysis. 
      Nevertheless, an excessive ultrasonic power like 750 W hindered protein 
      hydrolysis and further exerted a negative effect on peptide generation. 
      Therefore, ultrasound under controlled conditions could be considered as a 
      promising way to improve the taste of unsmoked bacon.

AB  - In this study, a new electrochemical sensor was designed based on a hybrid of 
      polyamide (PA) and chromotropic acid (CA) nanofibers electrospun on a glassy 
      carbon electrode (GCE) configured as PANFs-CANFs/GCE. The electrochemical 
      response of this sensor showed an excellent electrochemical activity for the 
      detection of Hg(2+) ions using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse 
      voltammetry (DPV) methods. The proposed sensor exhibited the prominent 
      electrocatalytic value of (α = 0.60, Log Ks = 3.45 s(-1) and Γ = 3.30 × 10 (-9) 
      mmol/cm(2)) as a result of PANFs-CANFs/GCE response to Hg(2+) ions. The 
      recommended sensor also demonstrated a linear portion in the calibration curve 
      over the concentration range of 30 to 450 nM with the limit of detection (LOD) 
      and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 9.98 nM and 29.97 nM, respectively. The 
      fabricated sensor revealed reproducible and repeatable responses with a high 
      level of stability. Therefore, we highly recommend this new electro-spun based 
      sensor for quantifying Hg(2+) in drinking water and canned fish samples with the 
      accurate and precise results and no side interferences.

AB  - The effective detection of biomarkers associated with hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) is of great importance. Golgi protein 73 (GP73), a serum biomarker of HCC, 
      has better diagnostic value than Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has been reported. In 
      this paper, highly accurate fluorescence sensing platform for detecting GP73 was 
      constructed based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), in which 
      nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) labelling with GP73 aptamer 
      (GP73(Apt)) was used as fluorescence probe, and molybdenum disulfide @ reduced 
      graphene oxide (MoS(2)@RGO) nanosheets was used as fluorescent receptors. 
      MoS(2)@RGO nanosheets can quench the fluorescence of NGQDs-GP73(Apt) owing to 
      FRET mechanisms. In the presence of GP73, the NGQDs-GP73(Apt) specifically bound 
      with GP73 to from the deployable structures, making NGQDs-GP73(Apt) far away from 
      MoS(2)@RGO nanosheets, blocking the FRET process, resulting in fluorescence 
      recovery of NGQDs-GP73(Apt). Under optimal conditions, the recovery intensity of 
      fluorescence in the detection system is linearly related to the concentration of 
      GP73 in the range of 5 ng/mL - 100 ng/mL and the limit of detection is 4.54 ng/mL 
      (S/N = 3). Moreover, detection of GP73 was performed in human serum samples with 
      good recovery (97.21-100.83%). This platform provides a feasible method for the 
      early diagnosis of HCC, and can be easily extended to the detection of other 
      biomarkers.

AB  - The distinction in coordination modes of metal complexes leads to their versatile 
      structural features and unique properties. Here, we report two tetradentate 
      Schiff base ligands (H(2)L(1) and H(2)L(2)) bearing N(2)O(2) donor sets, 
      tactically selected to provide distinct coordination modes with different metal 
      ions. The ligands were utilized to synthesize their organotin(IV) (1-4) and 
      vanadium(V) (5) derivatives. The synthesized compounds were characterized using 
      elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, multi-nuclei NMR ((1)H, (13)C, and 
      (119)Sn) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. 
      The organotin(IV) derivatives (1-4) displayed hepta-coordination around both the 
      Sn centres as they were achieved in their dimeric form. Contrariwise, the 
      vanadium(V) compound (5) was isolated as a mononuclear entity exhibiting 
      penta-coordinated geometry around the vanadium centre. The variation in the 
      coordination modes was evident in their UV-vis and fluorescence spectra. The 
      organotin(IV) compounds (1-4) exhibited a strong emission band centred at 468 nm 
      when excited at a wavelength of 360 nm whereas the vanadium(V) (5) derivative 
      displayed poor fluorogenic response. Compound 1 was further explored for the 
      fluorogenic chemo-sensing of permanganate ions (MnO(4)(-)) amongst various anions 
      by quenching response. A detailed investigation of the recognition of 
      permanganate ions was accomplished by spectrofluorometric, spectroscopic ((119)Sn 
      NMR), mass spectrometric, and computational studies.

AB  - Although aluminum is a ubiquitous metal in the ecosystem and has numerous 
      critical roles in both the medicinal and biological fields, human daily life is 
      seriously threatened by its assorted harmful influences. By this virtue, tracking 
      the amount of aluminum byrapid sensitive and selective recognition methodologies 
      is of great importance. Based on this, a novel fluorescent chemosensor 
      4,4'-(propane-2,2-diyl)bis(2-(((-2-hydroxybenzylidene) 
      hydrazineylidene)-methyl)phenol) (BFASA) capable of recognizing Al(3+) in a 
      medium was constructed via an easy Schiff-base reaction between bisphenol 
      A-containing molecule and the salicylaldehyde. The metal-binding studies of BFASA 
      indicated a drastically enhanced emission with color alteration from colorless to 
      green establishing the utility of BFASA against monitoring of Al(3+) and only 
      Cu(2+)/Al(3+) significantly enhanced the absorbance intensity of the probe 
      solution at 433 and 406, respectively. Its ability to selectively sense Al(3+) 
      demonstrated "switch-on" fluorescence responses for Al(3+) with a low detection 
      limit (LOD) of 0.56 μM and good selectivity, and pH adaptation range (5-8). The 
      stoichiometric ratio of BFASA against the Al(3+) was verified by the Job's plot 
      and TOF-MS analysis and determined as 1:2. To make the recognition process 
      inexpensively, viable and straightforward, Smartphone application of BFASA was 
      effectively applied to Al(3+) sensing, which could benefit the on-site Al(3+) 
      recognition. In the fluorescence bio-imaging aspect, the BFASA could effectively 
      monitor Al(3+) in living cells.

AB  - Fluorometric sensors for the detection of nerve agent mimics have received a lot 
      of interest nowadays due to their high sensitivity and selectivity, ease of 
      operation, and real-time monitoring. Pyridinic-N-rich carbon dots (NCDs) prepared 
      through microwave-assisted pyrolysis of l-Malic acid and urea have been explored 
      first time in this work as a novel turn-off fluorescent probe for the sensitive 
      and selective detection of diethyl chlorophosphate (DCP), a nerve agent mimic. 
      The as-prepared carbon dots contained a large amount of pyridinic nitrogen on 
      their surface, which can modulate the photoluminescence properties of the NCDs. 
      The blue emissive NCDs possessed both excitation wavelength-dependent and 
      independent emission behavior. The detection of DCP was premised on quenching of 
      the fluorescence emission intensity of NCDs in the presence of similar chemical 
      reagents (e.g., trimethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, triethyl 
      phosphonoacetate, triphenyl phosphate, diphenyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate). 
      Fluorescence quenching of the NCDs in the presence of DCP has been attributed to 
      the inner filter effect (IFE). From the linear Stern-Volmer plot (R(2) = 0.9992), 
      the limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 84 μM for sensing DCP for the 
      concentration ranging between 3 and 15 mM. The biocompatibility of NCDs was 
      assessed through cytotoxicity assay on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. 
      Fluorescence imaging demonstrated that NCDs have low cytotoxicity and can be 
      employed successfully in cell imaging.

AB  - Spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spmd) are considered as potential biomarker for 
      early diagnosis of human cancer. Herein, a novel acyclic cucurbituril derivative 
      (UL-ACB) was firstly designed and synthesized, which fluoresces at 460 nm after 
      excitation at 365 nm. UL-ACB is rich in oxygen atoms which are capable of forming 
      coordinate bonds with copper (Cu(2+)) that cause quenching of UL-ACB 
      fluorescence. Moreover, the addition of biological endogenous substances Spm and 
      Spmd can turn on fluorescence of UL-ACB. Interestingly, the probe showed a 
      remarkable detection efficiency for Spm and Spmd in human urine (the detection 
      limits of Spm and Spmd were 0.156 μM and 0.762 μM, and the linear ranges are 
      0.156 ∼ 43.06 μM and 0.762 ∼ 29.10 μM), which completely covered the early 
      diagnosis of urinary Spm (1 ∼ 10 μM) and urine Spmd (1 ∼ 20 μM) required 
      concentration range in cancer patients. The probe for Spm and Spmd is simple, 
      time-saving and selective, which may provide a new promising strategy for early 
      cancer diagnosis.

AB  - Despite the fact that C-Myc G-quadruplex in the oncogene promoter regions is one 
      of the crucial targets of antitumor drugs, the selectivities and proliferation 
      inhibitions of its probes towards tumor cells remain a big challenge. Until now, 
      no effective C-Myc G-quadruplex probes have been reported as a photosensitizer to 
      increase their antitumor activities. Here, the first NIR C-Myc G-quadruplex probe 
      PDS-SQ has been designed, comprising a G-quadruplex binder PDS and a squaraine 
      dye SQ as a photosensitizer. Conjugate PDS-SQ could selectively NIR image C-Myc 
      Pu22 G-quadruplex in tumor cells, and show stronger antitumor activity in the 
      irradiation by a chemo-photodynamic method than in the dark. The study provides a 
      new way to develop the novel NIR C-Myc G-quadruplex probes with more potent 
      antitumor activities.

AB  - Sonodynamic therapy involving the non-invasive and local generation of lethal 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) via ultrasound (US) with sonosensitizers has been 
      proposed as an emerging tumor therapy strategy. However, such therapy is usually 
      associated with inertial cavitation and unnecessary damage to healthy tissue 
      because current sonosensitizers have insufficient sensitivity to US. Here, we 
      report the use of a new proposed sonosensitizer, carbon dots (C-dots), to 
      assemble microbubbles with a gas core (C-dots MBs). As the C-dots were directly 
      integrated into the MB shell, they could effectively absorb the energy of 
      inertial cavitation and transfer it to ROS. Our results revealed the appearance 
      of (1)O(2), •OH, and H(2)O(2) after US irradiation of C-dots MBs. In in vitro 
      experiments, treatment with C-dots MBs plus US induced lipid peroxidation, 
      elevation of intracellular ROS, and apoptosis in 32.5%, 45.3%, and 50.1% of cells 
      respectively. In an animal solid tumor model, treatment with C-dots MBs plus US 
      resulted in a 3-fold and 2.5-fold increase in the proportion of ROS-damaged cells 
      and apoptotic cells, respectively, compared to C-dots MBs alone. These results 
      will pave the way for the design of novel multifunctional sonosensitizers for SDT 
      tumor therapy.

AB  - The current work combines headspace solid phase microextraction-gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) with multivariate analysis 
      fusion metabonomics for examining metabolite profile changes. The correlation 
      with metabolic pathways during the fermentation of kombucha tea were 
      comprehensively explored. For optimizing the fermentation process, 
      ultrasound-assisted factors were explored. A total of 132 metabolites released by 
      fermented kombucha were detected by HS-SPME-GC/MS. We employed the principal 
      component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) 
      to present the relationship between aroma components and fermentation time, of 
      which the first two principal components respectively accounted for 60.3% and 
      6.5% of the total variance. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that during 
      the fermentation of kombucha tea, there were significant differences in the 
      phenotypes of metabolites in the samples, and 25 characteristic metabolites were 
      selected as biomarkers. Leaf alcohol was first proposed as the characteristic 
      volatile in the fermentation process of kombucha. Furthermore, we addressed the 
      generation pathways of characteristic volatiles, their formation mechanisms, and 
      the transformational correlation among them. Our findings provide a roadmap for 
      future kombucha fermentation processing to enhance kombucha flavor and aroma.

AB  - The effect of pH on the occurrence states of peanut protein isolate (PPI) and 
      high methoxyl pectin (HMP), and droplet breakup model of the emulsions under 
      ultrasound were studied. Particle size distribution and scanning electron 
      microscopy results showed that PPI-HMP existed a soluble complex at pH 5.0, had 
      no interaction at pH 7.0, and was co-soluble at pH 9.0. Droplet breakup model 
      results revealed that the characteristics of emulsion stabilised by PPI-HMP 
      treated at pH 5.0 was different from that at pH 7.0 and 9.0. The average diameter 
      of the droplet well satisfied the model. According to rheological properties, 
      interface tension, and microstructure, the formation mechanism and 
      characteristics of emulsion stabilised by PPI-HMP treated at pH 5.0 was different 
      from that at pH 7.0 and pH 9.0. The research provided a reference for 
      constructing emulsions using pH-shifted PPI-HMP under ultrasound.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To explore the associations of genetically proxied TYK2 inhibition 
      with a wide range of disease outcomes and biomarkers to identify therapeutic 
      repurposing opportunities, adverse effects, and biomarkers of efficacy. METHODS: 
      The loss-of-function missense variant rs34536443 in TYK2 gene was used as a 
      genetic instrument to proxy the effect of TYK2 inhibition. A phenome-wide 
      Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to explore the associations of 
      genetically-proxied TYK2 inhibition with 1473 disease outcomes in UK Biobank 
      (N = 339,197). Identified associations were examined for replication in FinnGen 
      (N = 260,405). We further performed tissue-specific gene expression MR, 
      colocalization analyses, and MR with 247 blood biomarkers. A systematic review of 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on TYK2 inhibitor was performed to complement 
      the genetic evidence. FINDINGS: PheWAS-MR found that genetically-proxied TYK2 
      inhibition was associated with lower risk of a wide range of autoimmune diseases. 
      The associations with hypothyroidism and psoriasis were confirmed in MR analysis 
      of tissue-specific TYK2 gene expression and the associations with systemic lupus 
      erythematosus, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis were observed in 
      colocalization analysis. There were nominal associations of genetically-proxied 
      TYK2 inhibition with increased risk of prostate and breast cancer but not in 
      tissue-specific expression MR or colocalization analyses. Thirty-seven blood 
      biomarkers were associated with the TYK2 loss-of-function mutation. Evidence from 
      RCTs confirmed the effectiveness of TYK2 inhibitors on plaque psoriasis and 
      reported several adverse effects. INTERPRETATION: This study supports TYK2 
      inhibitor as a potential treatment for psoriasis and several other autoimmune 
      diseases. Increased pharmacovigilance is warranted in relation to the potential 
      adverse effects. FUNDING: None.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bornyl acetate (BA), a chemical component of essential oil in the 
      Pinus family, has yet to be actively studies in terms of its therapeutic effect 
      on numerous diseases, including autoimmune diseases. PURPOSE: This study aimed to 
      investigate the pharmacological effects and molecular mechanisms of BA on myelin 
      oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(35-55))-induced experimental autoimmune 
      encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), a 
      representative autoimmune disease in central nervous system. METHODS: BA (100, 
      200, or 400 mg/kg) was orally treated to EAE mice once daily for 30 days after 
      immunization for the behavioral test and for the 16th-18th days for the 
      histopathological and molecular analyses, from the onset stage (8th day) of EAE 
      symptoms. RESULTS: BA mitigated behavioral dysfunction (motor disability) and 
      demyelination in the spinal cord that were associated with the down-regulation of 
      representative pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and 
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha), enzymes (cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric 
      oxide synthase), and chemokines (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage 
      inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and regulated on activation), and decreased 
      infiltration of microglia (CD11b(+)/CD45(+(low))) and macrophages 
      (CD11b(+)/CD45(+(high))). The anti-inflammatory effect of BA was related to the 
      inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappa B 
      pathways. BA also reduced the recruitment/infiltration rates of CD4(+) T, Th1, 
      and Th17 cells into the spinal cords of EAE mice, which was related to reduced 
      blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption. CONCLUSION: These findings strongly 
      suggest that BA may alleviate EAE due to its anti-inflammatory and BSCB 
      protective activities. This indicates that BA is a potential therapeutic agent 
      for treating autoimmune demyelinating diseases including MS.

      stimulating macrophage M2 polarization via potentiating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling 
      pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress and chronic non-infectious inflammation caused 
      vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) is a critical and initiating factor in 
      Type 2 diabetes induced vascular complications, while macrophage polarization 
      plays a regulatory role in VED. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) has been widely 
      used for treating diabetic vascular diseases, but its mechanisms of action have 
      not been fully elucidated. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the 
      modulatory effects of APS on macrophage polarization and to reveal the potential 
      mechanisms of APS in LPS and HG stimulated macrophages and diabetic model rats. 
      METHODS: In vitro and in vivo studies were used to explore the mechanism of APS. 
      The macrophage polarization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release was 
      monitored by flow cytometry and the associated inflammatory factors were detected 
      by ELISA. For oxidative stress regulatory pathway detection, protein expression 
      of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) 
      was measured by Western blotting. The vascular endothelial functions were 
      measured by transwell, tube formation assay, scratch assay, adhesion assay. The 
      thoracic aorta pathological changes were evaluated by Haematoxylin-eosin and 
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In vitro, APS inhibited the LPS/HG-stimulated 
      THP-1 macrophage differentiated into macrophage M1, coupling with reduction in 
      the ROS production and pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12) release. 
      Furthermore, endothelial cells proliferation and apoptosis were ameliorated after 
      APS treatment. Meanwhile, APS-treated THP-1/macrophage occurred a differentiation 
      into M2 polarization and anti-inflammatory factors (IL-4, IL-10, and Arg-1) 
      release via enhancing Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, which could be disturbed by 
      using siNrf2. APS promoted the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells in 
      co-cultured of HUVECs and macrophages under high glucose. Finally, similar 
      results were observed in vivo, APS alleviated thoracic aorta complications of 
      diabetic rats accompanied by a remarkable reduction in inflammation and an 
      increased in the number of anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. CONCLUSION: 
      Our results demonstrated that APS ameliorated vascular endothelial dysfunction in 
      diabetes by stimulating macrophage polarization to M2 via enhancing the Nrf2/HO-1 
      pathway.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has extremely threatened human health, and automated 
      algorithms are needed to segment infected regions in the lung using computed 
      tomography (CT). Although several deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have 
      proposed for this purpose, their performance on this task is suppressed due to 
      the limited local receptive field and deficient global reasoning ability. To 
      address these issues, we propose a segmentation network with a novel pixel-wise 
      sparse graph reasoning (PSGR) module for the segmentation of COVID-19 infected 
      regions in CT images. The PSGR module, which is inserted between the encoder and 
      decoder of the network, can improve the modeling of global contextual 
      information. In the PSGR module, a graph is first constructed by projecting each 
      pixel on a node based on the features produced by the encoder. Then, we convert 
      the graph into a sparsely-connected one by keeping K strongest connections to 
      each uncertainly segmented pixel. Finally, the global reasoning is performed on 
      the sparsely-connected graph. Our segmentation network was evaluated on three 
      publicly available datasets and compared with a variety of widely-used 
      segmentation models. Our results demonstrate that (1) the proposed PSGR module 
      can capture the long-range dependencies effectively and (2) the segmentation 
      model equipped with this PSGR module can accurately segment COVID-19 infected 
      regions in CT images and outperform all other competing models.

AB  - Sleep Apnea (SA) is a respiratory disorder that affects sleep. However, the SA 
      detection method based on polysomnography is complex and not suitable for home 
      use. The detection approach using Photoplethysmography is low cost and 
      convenient, which can be used to widely detect SA. This study proposed a method 
      combining a multi-scale one-dimensional convolutional neural network and a shadow 
      one-dimensional convolutional neural network based on dual-channel input. The 
      time-series feature information of different segments were extracted from 
      multi-scale temporal structure. Moreover, shadow module was adopted to make full 
      use of the redundant information generated after multi-scale convolution 
      operation, which improved the accuracy and ensured the portability of the model. 
      At the same time, we introduced balanced bootstrapping and class weight, which 
      effectively alleviated the problem of unbalanced classes. Our method achieved the 
      result of 82.0% average accuracy, 74.4% average sensitivity and 85.1% average 
      specificity for per-segment SA detection, and reached 93.6% average accuracy for 
      per-recording SA detection after 5-fold cross validation. Experimental results 
      show that this method has good robustness. It can be regarded as an effective aid 
      in SA detection in household use.

AB  - Brain-computer Interface (BCI) system based on motor imagery (MI) heavily relies 
      on electroencephalography (EEG) recognition with high accuracy. However, modeling 
      and classification of MI EEG signals remains a challenging task due to the 
      non-linear and non-stationary characteristics of the signals. In this paper, a 
      new time-varying modeling framework combining multiwavelet basis functions and 
      regularized orthogonal forward regression (ROFR) algorithm is proposed for the 
      characterization and classification of MI EEG signals. Firstly, the time-varying 
      coefficients of the time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) model are precisely 
      approximated with the multiwavelet basis functions. Then a powerful ROFR 
      algorithm is employed to dramatically alleviate the redundant model structure and 
      accurately recover the relevant time-varying model parameters to obtain high 
      resolution power spectral density (PSD) features. Finally, the features are sent 
      to different classifiers for the classification task. To effectively improve the 
      accuracy of classification, a principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is 
      utilized to determine the best feature subset and Bayesian optimization algorithm 
      is performed to obtain the optimal parameters of the classifier. The proposed 
      method achieves satisfactory classification accuracy on the public BCI 
      Competition II Dataset III, which proves that this method potentially improves 
      the recognition accuracy of MI EEG signals, and has great significance for the 
      construction of BCI system based on MI.

AB  - PURPOSE: Metal artifacts can significantly decrease the quality of computed 
      tomography (CT) images. This occurs as X-rays penetrate implanted metals, causing 
      severe attenuation and resulting in metal artifacts in the CT images. This 
      degradation in image quality can hinder subsequent clinical diagnosis and 
      treatment planning. Beam hardening artifacts are often manifested as severe strip 
      artifacts in the image domain, affecting the overall quality of the reconstructed 
      CT image. In the sinogram domain, metal is typically located in specific areas, 
      and image processing in these regions can preserve image information in other 
      areas, making the model more robust. To address this issue, we propose a 
      region-based correction of beam hardening artifacts in the sinogram domain using 
      deep learning. METHODS: We present a model composed of three modules: (a) a 
      Sinogram Metal Segmentation Network (Seg-Net), (b) a Sinogram Enhancement Network 
      (Sino-Net), and (c) a Fusion Module. The model starts by using the Attention 
      U-Net network to segment the metal regions in the sinogram. The segmented metal 
      regions are then interpolated to obtain a sinogram image free of metal. The 
      Sino-Net is then applied to compensate for the loss of organizational and 
      artifact information in the metal regions. The corrected metal sinogram and the 
      interpolated metal-free sinogram are then used to reconstruct the metal CT and 
      metal-free CT images, respectively. Finally, the Fusion Module combines the two 
      CT images to produce the result. RESULTS: Our proposed method shows strong 
      performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The peak 
      signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the CT image before and after correction was 
      18.22 and 30.32, respectively. The structural similarity index measure (SSIM) 
      improved from 0.75 to 0.99, and the weighted peak signal-to-noise ratio (WPSNR) 
      increased from 21.69 to 35.68. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method demonstrates the 
      reliability of high-accuracy correction of beam hardening artifacts.

AB  - For people with psychotic disorders, the negative outcomes associated with 
      continuing cannabis use would suggest that discontinuing such use may be 
      beneficial for their symptomatic and functional recovery. However, existing 
      evidence that discontinuation is associated with better clinical outcomes is 
      inconsistent and it remains unclear whether discontinuing use is associated with 
      improvements in outcomes for people with an established psychotic disorder. In 
      this 3-5-year longitudinal study we examined baseline and follow-up symptomatic 
      and functional profiles of 371 people with an established psychotic disorder, 
      comparing those who continued to use cannabis with those who discontinued use 
      after baseline assessment. At follow-up, one third (33.3 %) of baseline cannabis 
      users had discontinued use. Discontinuation was associated with significantly 
      lower odds of past-year hallucinations and a mean improvement in level of 
      functioning (Personal and Social Performance Scale) compared to a decline in 
      functioning in continuing users. No significant differences in severity of 
      negative symptoms were observed. With few longitudinal studies examining 
      symptomatic and functional outcomes for people with established psychotic 
      disorders who continue to use cannabis compared to those who discontinue use, our 
      findings that discontinuing cannabis was associated with significant clinical 
      improvements fill gaps in the evidence-base.

AB  - The phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) is known to regulate plant immunity against 
      pathogens. Plants synthesize SA via the isochorismate synthase (ICS) pathway or 
      the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathway. The ICS pathway has been fully 
      characterized using Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant that exhibits 
      pathogen-inducible SA accumulation. Many species including Populus (poplar) 
      depend instead on the partially understood PAL pathway for constitutive as well 
      as pathogen-stimulated SA synthesis. Diversity of SA-mediated defense is also 
      evident in SA accumulation, redox regulation, and interplay with other hormones 
      like jasmonic acid. This review highlights the contrast between Arabidopsis and 
      poplar, discusses potential drivers of SA diversity in plant defenses, and offers 
      future research directions.

AB  - Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) is an idiopathic tropical disorder that is 
      characterized by the development of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Neglected EMF can 
      cause sudden cardiac death (SCD) in adults. Conclusive diagnosis of EMF depends 
      on autopsy after death. In an effort to attract the interest of the community for 
      this rare disease, we report two cases of SCD that were diagnosed as EMF during 
      autopsy in Egypt. Both cases were thoroughly investigated with emphasis on death 
      circumstances and post-mortem anatomical and histopathological findings. The two 
      cases were for adult males presented with SCD following a quarrel with a negative 
      medical history and family history regarding cardiac diseases. No trauma or drug 
      abuse. The autopsy revealed hypertrophied hearts, thick fibrosed endocardium, 
      patchy myocardial fibrosis, and filling of the apex by fibrosis and 
      calcifications. In one of them, there was a huge mural thrombus reaching the 
      level of the mitral valve that totally occluded the cavity of the left ventricle. 
      Histopathologically, fibrosis was confirmed, and no eosinophils were detected. In 
      contrast to previously reported cases in Egypt, the left ventricle was solely 
      affected. Despite the rarity of the disease outside the tropics, the frequency of 
      EMF cases is more likely to be more than the number of reported cases. EMF should 
      be considered as possible cause of SCD during autopsy. Further studies are needed 
      to clarify the etiology and epidemiology of EMF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The profile of deaths related to coronavirus disease of 2019 
      (COVID-19) that occurred outside the hospital in Japan remains unclear because of 
      cautious stance on performing autopsies of COVID-19 positive cases. METHODS: 
      Autopsy cases that tested positive for COVID-19 in the Tokyo Metropolis from 
      April 2020 to July 2022 were handled by medical examiners (n = 41). Age, sex, 
      medical history, autopsy findings, cause of death, postmortem computed tomography 
      (PMCT) findings, and the causal relationship between death and COVID-19 were 
      examined. RESULTS: The mean age of the deceased was 58.0 years (range: 
      28-96 years), and the study sample consisted of 33 males (80.5%) and 8 females 
      (19.5%). The most frequent medical histories were hypertension (n = 7) and 
      diabetes (n = 7), followed by mental disorders (n = 5). Nineteen cases showed a 
      body mass index ≧25.0 (46.3%). The leading cause of death was pneumonia (n = 17), 
      in which diffuse ground-glass opacification and/or consolidation was noted on 
      PMCT. There were 26 deaths directly related to COVID-19 (63.4%), including 
      pneumonia, myocarditis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and emaciation. The proportion 
      of deaths directly related to COVID-19 was lower after 2022 (42.1%) than prior to 
      2022 (81.8%). CONCLUSION: Pneumonia was the leading cause of death in this study 
      sample; however, the causes of death in COVID-19 positive cases varied, 
      especially after 2022, when the omicron variant was dominant. Mortality 
      statistics may be affected by viral mutations, and the results of this study 
      further emphasize the need for autopsy because more differential diagnoses should 
      be considered in the phase of the omicron variant.

AB  - Sex estimation is the primary step in biological profiling via identification 
      using skeletal elements. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
      usefulness of the seventh cervical vertebra for sex estimation. The cervical 
      computed tomography scans of 200 female and 200 male patients aged ≥ 20 years 
      were analyzed. Eight different measurements of the seventh cervical vertebra were 
      performed, including the transverse and anteroposterior diameters of the foramen 
      vertebra, transverse and anteroposterior diameters of the corpus vertebra 
      inferior surface, height of the corpus vertebra, corpus vertebrae-spinous process 
      angle, and height and length of the spinous process. Independent two-sample 
      t-test was performed; significant differences were observed between the sexes in 
      all measurements except corpus vertebrae-spinous process angle. Further, 
      univariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the length of spinous 
      process showed the highest dimorphism. Among the univariate models created, the 
      model obtained using only the length of the spinous process reached an accuracy 
      rate of 80 %. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (via Forward LR Wald) was 
      used for sex estimation with an accuracy of up to 90.8 % (89 % for men and 92.5 % 
      for women). In conclusion, the seventh cervical vertebra is dimorphic in the 
      Turkish population and allows sex estimation with high accuracy rates.

AB  - Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a kind of reversible inflammatory process of 
      the exocrine pancreas with gastrointestinal motility dysfunction involved. 
      Studies have highlighted the role of long noncoding RNA metastasis associated 
      lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) in AP. However, the mechanism 
      underlying its role in the gastrointestinal motility dysfunction remains 
      undefined. Hence, we explored the regulatory role of MALAT1 in gastrointestinal 
      motility dysfunction following SAP. Then, the expression of 
      CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB), MALAT1 and cold-inducible RNA 
      binding protein (CIRBP) was detected in plasma of SAP patients and pancreatic and 
      intestinal tissues of SAP mouse models with their correlation analyzed also. 
      Additionally, the effect of MALAT1 on the pancreatic and intestinal injury, 
      expression of inflammatory factors and the ERK pathway-related genes as well as 
      gastrointestinal motility dysfunction was assessed using ectopic expression and 
      depletion experiments. CEBPB, MALAT1 and CIRBP were highly expressed in plasma of 
      SAP patients and pancreatic and intestinal tissues of SAP mice. Further analysis 
      showed that knockdown of MALAT1 could alleviate pancreatic and intestinal injury, 
      reduce inflammation, and prevent gastrointestinal motility dysfunction in SAP 
      mice. The transcription factor CEBPB could bind to the promoter region of MALAT1, 
      thus activating the transcription of MALAT1. MALAT1 interacted with CIRBP and 
      inhibited the degradation of CIRBP, leading to activated extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and the resultant gastrointestinal motility 
      dysfunction. In conclusion, CEBPB exhibits a promoting activity towards 
      gastrointestinal motility dysfunction in SAP by pumping up MALAT1 expression and 
      activating the CIRBP-dependent ERK pathway.

AB  - Biomarker measurements in spot urine are often adjusted for creatinine to control 
      for dilution resulting from individual hydration. We here report on results of a 
      study involving age- and sex-matched vegans and omnivores (n = 36 each). The 
      daily urinary excretion of 2,3-dihydroxypropylmercapturic acid (DHPMA, a 
      diet-independent endogenous C3-metabolite used as an example compound) was found 
      not to be different in vegans and omnivores (median 433 μg/24 h each), however, 
      creatinine-adjusted levels were 26% lower in omnivores (median 285 μg/g 
      creatinine) than in vegans (median 383 μg/g creatinine, p = 0.003). This 
      difference results from the higher urinary excretion of creatinine in the 
      omnivores compared to vegans (median 1.51 vs. 1.21 g/24 h, p = 0.009). Linear 
      regression showed - besides the fat-free mass - a significant impact of the 
      factor diet (vegans vs. omnivores). This may be due to the consumption of meat 
      and fish as exogenous sources of creatinine. A literature search revealed broad 
      evidence for this interpretation, as creatinine is formed from creatine during 
      heating of meat and fish. Accordingly, consumption leads to temporary increase of 
      serum/plasma creatinine and urinary creatinine excretion, resulting in higher 
      levels in omnivores compared to vegans/vegetarians. An adjustment of the urinary 
      DHPMA concentrations using specific gravity revealed 13% lower values in 
      omnivores (median 225 μg/L) than in vegans (median 260 μg/L, p = 0.07). Compared 
      to creatinine-adjustment, adjustment for specific gravity introduces a smaller 
      but still obvious difference between omnivores and vegans. Especially with 
      respect to future studies comparing vegans, vegetarians and omnivores, 
      researchers should be aware of the risks of severe misinterpretations if 
      biomarker measurements in spot urine are adjusted for creatinine.

AB  - Inflammation plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD). Thymol is a bioactive monoterpene isolated from Thymus vulgaris 
      that has anti-inflammatory properties and is helpful in neurodevelopmental 
      disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of thymol on 
      autism-like behaviours in rats with VPA-induced ASD and to assess the related 
      molecular mechanisms. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the valproic acid 
      (VPA)-exposed rat model, the levels of Pin1, phosphorylated p38 MAPK, 
      interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, were increased, and 
      the levels of PSD95 and synaptophysin (SYP) decreased. After thymol treatment 
      (30 mg/kg), the VPA-induced autism-like behaviours were alleviated. Moreover, 
      thymol also rescued the dysregulated levels of Pin1, phosphorylated p38 MAPK, 
      IL-1β, TNF-α, PSD95, and SYP. In addition, immunofluorescence experiments showed 
      that thymol treatment decreased the correlation between Pin1 and phosphorylated 
      p38 MAPK. Mechanistically, Pin1 knockdown by RNA interference confirmed that Pin1 
      promotes inflammation via phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the VPA exposure rat 
      model. In conclusion, thymol improved autism-like behaviours in VPA-induced ASD 
      rats by reducing inflammation and improving neurodevelopment. This effect was 
      mediated by the Pin1/p38 MAPK pathway. These results experimentally provide the 
      potential for thymol in new therapeutic avenues for autism.

AB  - Itching is an unpleasant sensation on the skin that could negatively impact the 
      quality of life. Over the years, many non-pharmacological and pharmacological 
      approaches have been introduced to mitigate this burdensome condition; However, 
      the effectiveness of these methods remains questioned. Bromhexine, derived from 
      the Adhatoda vasica plant, is a safe drug with minimal side effects. It has been 
      widely used in managing respiratory symptoms over the years. The results of our 
      study revealed that bromhexine has the potential to alleviate acute itch induced 
      by Compound 48/80, a known mast cell destabilizer. According to our findings, 
      bromhexine exerts its antipruritic effects primarily by inhibiting the 
      Transmembrane Protein Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and, to a lesser extent, by 
      decreasing the activation of the Kynurenine Pathway (KP). We further investigated 
      the KP involvement by administrating 1-Methyl Tryptophan (1-MT), a known 
      indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor. 1-MT was found to be effective in 
      reducing the itch itself. Moreover, co-administration of bromhexine and 1-MT 
      resulted in synergistic antipruritic effects, suggesting that KP plays a role in 
      acute itch. To conclude, we have presented for the first time a repositioning of 
      bromhexine as a treatment for acute itch. In addition, we addressed the 
      involvement of TMPRSS2 and KP in this process.

AB  - Ketamine is commonly used for sedation, analgesia and anesthetics. Much evidence 
      has shown that it has an immune-regulatory effect. The cholinergic 
      anti-inflammatory pathway mediated by α7nAChR is a prominent target of 
      anti-inflammatory therapy. However, whether ketamine suppresses inflammatory 
      levels in nerve cells by activating α7nAChR remains unknown. Lipopolysaccharide 
      (LPS) was used to establish the neuroinflammation model in PC12 cells in vitro, 
      and α7nAChR siRNA was transfected into PC12 cells 30 min before LPS to inhibit 
      gene expression of α7nAChR. PC12 cells were stimulated with LPS for 24 h, and the 
      indicators were detected at 2 h after GTS-21 and ketamine were added. The results 
      showed that LPS increased the proportion of PC12 cells apoptosis, activated 
      TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, and increased the expression of interleukin-6 
      (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Ketamine 
      reduced the ratio of early apoptosis and late apoptosis of PC12, inhibited the 
      entry of P65 into the nucleus, decreased the activation of TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB and 
      improved neuroinflammation. However, the ameliorating effects of ketamine on 
      neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation were inhibited in the α7nAChRi group. 
      This indicated that α7nAChR played a key role in the anti-inflammatory process of 
      ketamine. Low-dose ketamine inhibited TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB by activating the 
      α7nAChR-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, thereby producing the 
      protective effect on neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a prevalent bone metabolic disease in menopause, and long-term 
      medication is accompanied by serious side effects. Ginger, a food spice and 
      traditional medicine with ancient history, exhibits the potential to alleviate 
      osteoporosis in preclinical experiments, whereas its complex composition leads to 
      ambiguous pharmacological mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to 
      investigate the effect and mechanism of Ced in estrogen-deficient osteoporosis, a 
      sesquiterpene alcohol recently discovered from Ginger with multiple 
      pharmacological properties. RANKL was stimulated BMM (bone marrow macrophages) 
      differentiation into osteoclasts in vitro. And the osteoclast activity and number 
      were assessed by TRAcP and SEM. We found that Ced mitigated RANKL-induced 
      osteoclastogenesis by descending the ROS content and obstructing NFATc1, NF-κB, 
      and MAPK signaling. Also, Ced-mediated anti-osteolytic property was found in 
      ovariectomized mice by Micro-CT scanning and histological staining. Summarily, 
      our works demonstrated the anti-osteoporotic potential of Cedrol in Ginger for 
      the first time, which also offered more pharmacological evidence for Ginger as 
      food or medicine used for bone metabolic disease.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious and common clinical disease. Despite 
      significant progress in ALI treatment, the morbidity and mortality rates remain 
      high. However, no effective drug has been discovered for ALI. FGF4, a member of 
      the FGF family, plays an important role in the regulation of various 
      physiological and pathological processes. Therefore, in the present study, we 
      aimed to study the protective effects of FGF4 against LPS-induced lung injury in 
      vivo and in vitro. We found that rFGF4 treatment improved the lung W/D weight 
      ratio, the survival rate, immune cell infiltration and protein concentrations in 
      mice with LPS-induced ALI. Histological analysis revealed that rFGF4 
      significantly attenuated lung tissue injury and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, 
      rFGF4 inhibited the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and the 
      production of pro-inflammatory mediators in LPS-injured lung tissues, murine 
      alveolar macrophages (MH-S) and murine pulmonary epithelial (MLE-12) cells. The 
      results of cell experiments further verified that rFGF4 inhibited the production 
      of inflammatory mediators in MH-S cells and MLE-12 cells by regulating the 
      TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. These results revealed that rFGF4 protected lung 
      tissues and inhibited inflammatory mediators in mice with LPS-induced ALI by 
      inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in MH-S and MLE-12 cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel artemisinin derivative, dihydroartemisinin-ursodeoxycholic 
      acid conjugate (4), was found to exhibit strong immunosuppressive activity. 
      Various methods were used to evaluate the immunosuppressive activity and 
      mechanism of action of the compound to explore its potential applications. 
      METHODS: T cell proliferation, mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), and Th1/Th17 
      differentiation assays were used to evaluate the immunosuppressive activity of 
      the compound. Differentially expressed genes from RNA sequencing were analysed 
      with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, 
      while enriched signalling pathways were further validated by western blotting 
      (WB). In vivo efficacy was validated with delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) 
      mouse models and dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) mouse model. RESULTS: Compound 4 inhibited concanavalin A -induced mouse 
      splenic T cell proliferation (IC(50) = 15 nM) and anti-CD3/CD28-induced human 
      primary T cell proliferation (IC(50) = 30 nM) while also reducing the secretion 
      of hIFN-γ. Compound 4 exhibited similar inhibitory activity in MLR assay. 
      Compound 4 dose-dependently inhibited human Th1/Th17 differentiation. The KEGG 
      pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the genes related to T cell activation 
      signalling pathways PI3K-AKT, MAPK, and NF-κB were significantly enriched. WB 
      confirmed that compound 4 inhibited the AKT/MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways. 
      Compound 4 dose-dependently inhibited ear and foot pad swelling in DTH mouse 
      models. In the DSS-induced IBD mouse model, compound 4 significantly decreased 
      the disease activity index and colon density, and inhibited splenomegaly of the 
      mice. CONCLUSION: The in vitro and in vivo results indicated that compound 4 has 
      the potential to be developed into an anti-IBD drug.

AB  - A variety of bioactive materials are currently developed to expand T cells ex 
      vivo for adoptive T cell immunotherapy, also known as called artificial 
      antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs). However, almost all the reported designs 
      exhibit relatively smooth surface modified with T cell activating biomolecules, 
      and therefore cannot well mimic the dendritic morphological characteristics of 
      dendritic cells (DCs), the most important type of natural antigen-presenting 
      cells (APCs) with high specific surface areas. Here, we propose a hydrophilic 
      monomer-mediated surface morphology control strategy to synthesize biocompatible 
      dendritic poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microspheres for constructing 
      aAPCs with surface morphology mimicking natural APCs (e.g., DCs). Interestingly, 
      when maintaining the same ligands density, dendritic polymeric microspheres-based 
      aAPCs (DPM beads) can more efficiently expand CD8(+) T cells than that with 
      smooth surfaces. Moreover, adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells 
      expanded by the DPM beads show significant antitumor effect of B16-OVA tumor 
      bearing mice. Therefore, we provide a new concept for constructing biomimetic 
      aAPCs with enhanced T cell expansion ability.

AB  - Osteoporosis is caused by the disruption in homeostasis between bone formation 
      and bone resorption. Conventional management of osteoporosis involves systematic 
      drug administration and hormonal therapy. These treatment strategies have limited 
      curative efficacy and multiple adverse effects. Biomaterials-based therapeutic 
      strategies have recently emerged as promising alternatives for the treatment of 
      osteoporosis. The present review summarizes the current status of biomaterials 
      designed for managing osteoporosis. The advantages of biomaterials-based 
      strategies over conventional systematic drug treatment are presented. Different 
      anti-osteoporotic delivery systems are concisely addressed. These materials 
      include injectable hydrogels and nanoparticles, as well as anti-osteoporotic bone 
      tissue engineering materials. Fabrication techniques such as 3D printing, 
      electrostatic spinning and artificial intelligence are appraised in the context 
      of how the use of these adjunctive techniques may improve treatment efficacy. The 
      limitations of existing biomaterials are critically analyzed, together with 
      deliberation of the future directions in biomaterials-based therapies. The latter 
      include discussion on the use of combination strategies to enhance therapeutic 
      efficacy in the osteoporosis niche.

AB  - Quantitative assessment of the structural, functional, and mechanical properties 
      of engineered tissues and biomaterials is fundamental to their development for 
      regenerative medicine applications. Ultrasound (US) imaging is a non-invasive, 
      non-destructive, and cost-effective technique capable of longitudinal and 
      quantitative monitoring of tissue structure and function across centimeter to 
      sub-micron length scales. Here we present the fundamentals of US to contextualize 
      its application for the assessment of biomaterials and engineered tissues, both 
      in vivo and in vitro. We review key studies that demonstrate the versatility and 
      broad capabilities of US for clinical and pre-clinical biomaterials research. 
      Finally, we highlight emerging techniques that further extend the applications of 
      US, including for ultrafast imaging of biomaterials and engineered tissues in 
      vivo and functional monitoring of stem cells, organoids, and organ-on-a-chip 
      systems in vitro.

AB  - Fees and fines collected through courts and law enforcement can comprise a 
      considerable proportion of revenue for local governments. Law enforcement, as 
      agents of revenue generation, change policing behavior to increase revenue, at 
      times targeting Black and brown neighborhoods to bolster municipal budgets. This 
      structural racism in revenue generation has not yet been assessed as an exposure 
      for adverse health. Using the 2012 Census of Governments, and 2011-2015 vital 
      statistics from the National Center of Health Statistics, we examine the 
      relationship between countyaverage fees and fines as a percent of total 
      own-source revenue and county-level characteristics, and risk of preterm birth 
      and low birthweight across the United States. Mothers residing in counties with 
      the greatest reliance on fees and fines had 1.08 (95% CI: 1.03-1.12) times the 
      odds of preterm birth and 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02-1.11) times the odds of low 
      birthweight than mothers residing in counties with the least reliance on fees and 
      fines, controlling for individual- and county-level covariates. The addition of 
      countylevel racial composition, and the Index of Concentration at the Extremes 
      (ICE), reduced these associations yet remained statistically significant. Future 
      studies should continue to examine how racist, exploitative revenue generation 
      through police and court activities influences the health of residents.

AB  - At physiological levels, the trace element selenium plays a key role in redox 
      reactions through the incorporation of selenocysteine in antioxidant enzymes. 
      Selenium has also been evaluated as a potential anti-cancer agent, where selenium 
      nanoparticles have proven effective, and are well tolerated in vivo at doses that 
      are toxic as soluble Se. The use of such nanoparticles, coated with either serum 
      albumin or the naturally occurring alkaline polysaccharide chitosan, also serves 
      to enhance biocompatibility and bioavailability. Here we demonstrate a novel role 
      for selenium in regulating histone methylation in ovarian cancer cell models 
      treated with inorganic selenium nanoparticles coated with serum albumin or 
      chitosan. As well as inducing thioredoxin reductase expression, ROS activity and 
      cancer cell cytotoxicity, coated nanoparticles caused significant increases in 
      histone methylation. Specifically, selenium nanoparticles triggered an increase 
      in the methylation of histone 3 at lysines K9 and K27, histone marks involved in 
      both the activation and repression of gene expression, thus suggesting a 
      fundamental role for selenium in these epigenetic processes. This direct function 
      was confirmed using chemical inhibitors of the histone lysine methyltransferases 
      EZH2 (H3K27) and G9a/EHMT2 (H3K9), both of which blocked the effect of selenium 
      on histone methylation. This novel role for selenium supports a distinct function 
      in histone methylation that occurs due to a decrease in S-adenosylhomocysteine, 
      an endogenous inhibitor of lysine methyltransferases, the metabolic product of 
      methyl-group transfer from S-adenosylmethionine in the one-carbon metabolism 
      pathway. These observations provide important new insights into the action of 
      selenium nanoparticles. It is now important to consider both the classic 
      antioxidant and novel histone methylation effects of this key redox element in 
      its development in cancer therapy and other applications.

AB  - Histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase is the sixth protein (hence HISN6) in the 
      histidine biosynthetic pathway in plants. HISN6 is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate 
      (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of imidazole 
      acetol phosphate into L-histidinol phosphate (HOLP). Here, we show that plant 
      HISN6 enzymes are closely related to the orthologs from Chloroflexota. The 
      studied example, HISN6 from Medicago truncatula (MtHISN6), exhibits a 
      surprisingly high affinity for HOLP, which is much higher than reported for 
      bacterial homologs. Moreover, unlike the latter, MtHISN6 does not transaminate 
      phenylalanine. High-resolution crystal structures of MtHISN6 in the open and 
      closed states, as well as the complex with HOLP and the apo structure without 
      PLP, bring new insights into the enzyme dynamics, pointing at a particular role 
      of a string-like fragment that oscillates near the active site and participates 
      in the HOLP binding. When MtHISN6 is compared to bacterial orthologs with known 
      structures, significant differences arise in or near the string region. The high 
      affinity of MtHISN6 appears linked to the particularly tight active site cavity. 
      Finally, a virtual screening against a library of over 1.3 mln compounds revealed 
      three sites in the MtHISN6 structure with the potential to bind small molecules. 
      Such compounds could be developed into herbicides inhibiting plant HISN6 enzymes 
      absent in animals, which makes them a potential target for weed control agents.

AB  - Potassium is one of the principal macronutrients required by all plants, but its 
      mobility is restricted between soil compartments. Numerous studies have shown 
      that Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria (PGPB) can facilitate nutrient uptake. The 
      present work examined the effects of the PGPB (Bacillus megaterium) on rice 
      plants subjected to potassium deprivation. To study only direct effects of B. 
      megaterium, we first checked its lack of capacity to solubilize soil K. Rice 
      plants were provided with 1.5 mM K (100%) or 0.015 mM K (1%) and growth related 
      parameters, nutrient concentrations and gene expression of K(+) transporters were 
      determined. After two weeks, the 1% K treatment reduced growth of non-inoculated 
      plants by about 50% compared with the 100% K treatment. However, there was no 
      effect of reduced K nutrition on growth of inoculated plants. The reduction in 
      growth in non-inoculated plants was accompanied by a similar reduction in K(+) 
      concentration in both roots and leaves and an overall 80% reduction of the plant 
      potassium concentrations. In inoculated plants a 50% reduction occurred only in 
      leaves. The expression of the K(+) transporters HKT1;1, 1;2, 1;5, 2;2, 2;3 and 
      2;4 was up-regulated by the inoculation of B. megaterium under K deprivation 
      conditions, explaining their higher K tissue concentrations and growth. Thus, the 
      bacterial strain improved plant potassium nutrition without affecting K(+) 
      availability in the soil. The results demonstrate the potential of this bacteria 
      for using as a biofertilizer to reduce the amount of potassium fertilizers to be 
      applied in the field.

AB  - Beta-lactam antibiotics are one of the most commonly used drug classes in 
      managing bacterial infections. However, their use is threatened by the alarming 
      phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance, which represents a worldwide health 
      concern. Given the continuous spread of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) producing 
      pathogens, the need to discover broad-spectrum β-lactamase inhibitors is 
      increasingly growing. A series of zinc chelators have been synthesized and 
      investigated for their ability to hamper the Zn-ion network of interactions in 
      the active site of MBLs. We assessed the inhibitory activity of new polyimidazole 
      ligands N,N'-bis((imidazol-4-yl)methyl)-ethylenediamine, 
      N,N,N'-tris((imidazol-4-yl)methyl)-ethylenediamine, 
      N,N,N,N'-tetra((imidazol-4-yl-methyl)-ethylenediamine toward three different 
      subclasses B1 MBLs: VIM-1, NDM-1 and IMP-1 by in vitro assays. The activity of 
      known zinc chelators such as 1,4,7,10,13-Pentaazacyclopentadecane, 
      1,4,8,11-Tetraazacyclotetradecane and 
      1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid was also assessed. 
      Moreover, a molecular docking study was carried to gain insight into the 
      interaction mode of the most active ligands.

AB  - Cancer nanomedicine has been investigated widely and boomed in the last two 
      decades, resulting in designing nanostructures with biofunctionalization, giving 
      rise to an "All-in-One" multifunctional platform. The development of rational 
      design technology with extended functionalities brought interdisciplinary 
      researchers to work continuously, aiming to find a prevent or effectively treat 
      the deadly disease of the century. Thus, it led to some Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA)-approving nano-based formulations for cancer treatment and 
      opening a vast area of promising discoveries by exploiting different 
      nanomaterials. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently gained tremendous 
      interest among scientists because of their outstanding structural, optical, 
      electronic, thermal, and mechanical characteristics. Among various 2D 
      nanomaterials, MXenes are a widely studied nanosystem because of their close 
      similarity to graphene analogs. So, it is synthesized using multiple approaches 
      and exploits their inherited properties. But in most cases, surface 
      functionalization techniques are carried out for targeting, site-specific drug 
      clearance, renal clearance, and biocompatible with healthy cells. Thus, 
      fabricating a multimodal agent for mono or combined therapies is also an 
      image-guided diagnostic agent. This review will explain the recent and emerging 
      advancements of MXenes-based composites as a multifunctional theragnostic agent 
      and discuss the possibilities of transferring laboratory research to clinical 
      translation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze trends in the incidence of 
      vaginal cancer in France over a 28-year period and to present survival for 
      recently-diagnosed women. METHODS: French cancer registries provided data on 
      invasive vaginal cancers diagnosed from 1990 to 2015 and followed up through June 
      2018. Trends in incidence were analyzed using a Poisson model with a 
      bidimensional penalized spline of age and year at diagnosis. Net survival 
      analysis was restricted to recently-diagnosed cases (2010-2015) and used a novel 
      approach based on a bidimensional penalized spline of age and 
      time-since-diagnosis to model excess mortality hazard. RESULTS: With 162 new 
      cases estimated in France in 2018, vaginal cancer represented 0.9 % of genital 
      cancers in French women. In 2018, the world population age-standardized incidence 
      rate was 0.2 per 100,000 person-years, median age at diagnosis was 75 years. The 
      standardized incidence rate decreased significantly by 3 % per year (95 % CI, 
      -3.8; -2.2) between 1990 and 2018 (0.4 cases per 100,000 person-year in 1990, vs 
      0.2 in 2018). Age-standardized net survival at 1 and 5 years after diagnosis was 
      respectively 74 % and 45 %. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that vaginal cancer 
      is still a rare malignancy in France with 5-year net survival that remains low. 
      We observed a consistent decrease in the incidence rate between 1990 and 2018. It 
      may be too early to attribute these trends to a positive impact of vaccination 
      campaigns against hrHPV infection, since vaginal cancer mainly affects older 
      women and HPV vaccination has only been available since the early 2000s, and only 
      targets young girls.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared in late 2019. It is caused by the severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Flu-like symptoms and 
      acute respiratory illnesses are the main manifestations of the disease. Recent 
      studies have confirmed the susceptibility of domestic animals to SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. However, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in household pets and the 
      importance of pets in the epidemiology of this infection remain unknown. In 
      Lebanon, there is no epidemiological data regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in 
      companion animals. Thus, this investigation aimed to determine the seroprevalence 
      of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in household pets of Lebanon during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. A cross-sectional study was carried out between April 2020 and February 
      2021. Blood samples from 145 cats and 180 dogs were collected from 12 veterinary 
      clinics located in the North, Mount, and Beirut governorates. A validated ELISA 
      assay was used to detect the anti- SARS-CoV-2 in the sera of the tested animals. 
      An overall seroprevalence of 16.92% (55/325) was reported; 13.79% seroprevalence 
      was found in cats (20/145) and 19.44% (35/180) in dogs. The young age and the 
      cold season were significantly associated with an increased seropositivity rate 
      to SARS-CoV-2 infection (P < 0.01). These results confirm the circulation of 
      SARS-CoV-2 in household pets, in various geographical regions in Lebanon. 
      Although, there is a lack of evidence to suggest that naturally infected pets 
      could transmit the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, owners diagnosed with COVID-19 
      should limit their contact with their animals during the course of the disease to 
      curb the risk of transmission.

AB  - Rabies is a worldwide zoonotic disease mainly transmitted to humans by an 
      infected dog bite. Despite the endemicity of rabies in dogs and few documented 
      cases in Cameroon, there is still not enough data on frequency of rabies cases in 
      animals. The present study aims to update data on the circulation of rabies in 
      animals screened at the Centre Pasteur of Cameroon (CPC) between 2014 and 2021. 
      The detection of rabies in animals was based on passive surveillance. Animal 
      rabies cases were confirmed on brain biopsies using fluorescent antibody test and 
      SYBR green based real-time RT-PCR for negative results confirmation. The total 
      nucleoprotein (N) gene of animal-derived RABV isolated were amplified by hemi 
      nested RT-PCR and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. From 2014 to 2021, a total 
      of 92 animals including 86 dogs (93.5%), 3 cats, 2 pigs and 1 chiropteran were 
      screened for rabies at the CPC. From the 86 dog sampled, 62.3% (54/86) were 
      tested positive for rabies and 1 out of 3 cat samples was also tested positive. 
      The PEP demand was very high (59,371) during the study period. Phylogenetic 
      analyses assigned all 15 studied isolates successfully sequenced to the Africa-1a 
      lineage belonging to the Cosmopolitan clade. The study highlights the frequent 
      circulation of rabies in Cameroon and the role of dogs and cat as main reservoir 
      and vector of rabies.

TI  - "It kinda has like a mind": Children's and parents' beliefs concerning viral

AB  - How people reason about disease transmission is central to their commonsense 
      theories, scientific literacy, and adherence to public health guidelines. This 
      study provided an in-depth assessment of U.S. children's (ages 5-12, N = 180) and 
      their parents' (N = 125) understanding of viral transmission of COVID-19 and the 
      common cold, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary aim was 
      to discover children's causal models of viral transmission, by asking them to 
      predict and explain counter-intuitive outcomes (e.g., asymptomatic disease, 
      symptom delay) and processes that cannot be directly observed (e.g., viral 
      replication, how vaccines work). A secondary aim was to explore parental factors 
      that might contribute to children's understanding. Although even the youngest 
      children understood germs as disease-causing and were highly knowledgeable about 
      certain behaviors that transmit or block viral disease (e.g., sneezing, 
      mask-wearing), they generally failed to appreciate the processes that play out 
      over time within the body. Overall, children appeared to rely on two competing 
      mental models of viruses: one in which viruses operate strictly via mechanical 
      processes (movement through space), and one in which viruses are small living 
      creatures, able to grow in size and to move by themselves. These results suggest 
      that distinct causal frameworks co-exist in children's understanding. A challenge 
      for the future is how to teach children about illness as a biological process 
      without also fostering inappropriate animism or anthropomorphism of viruses.

TI  - Understanding the relationship between the public sector healthcare workers and 
      NGO-based HIV counsellors while providing HIV counselling and testing services to 
      pregnant women: A Qualitative Study in Suva, Fiji.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) counselling and testing plays a significant 
      role in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. HIV counselling 
      and testing during pregnancy is an essential gateway for HIV prevention, timely 
      treatment, and care services. Lack of proper counselling could jeopardise the 
      quality of services. This paper aims to understand the relationship between the 
      government employed hospital healthcare workers and the Non-Governmental 
      Organisation based counsellors while providing HIV counselling and testing 
      services to pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in one of the main 
      hospitals in Suva, Fiji. Data were collected via individual, in-depth, interviews 
      held in a single hospital and an associated reproductive health centre in Suva in 
      April-May 2013. A total of 15 healthcare providers including doctors (n = 4), 
      midwives (n = 5), nurses (n = 4), and counsellors (n = 2) were interviewed. The 
      data were analysed using thematic analysis. Ethical approvals were obtained. We 
      found that there was tension between the government employed hospital healthcare 
      workers and the Non-Governmental Organisation based counsellors involved in the 
      provision of HIV counselling and testing services to pregnant women. The 
      predominant causes of tension were poor referral for HIV test counselling, long 
      counselling time, lack of cooperation and conflict due to the differences in 
      counselling approaches. Tension between the government employed hospital 
      healthcare workers and the Non- Governmental Organisation based HIV counsellors 
      appear to be the main challenge to effective provision of HIV test counselling 
      services in the hospital. Ongoing tension between both groups could restrict 
      healthcare workers abilities to provide quality HIV counselling services. Our 
      findings would be useful in developing strategies to overcome tension amongst 
      healthcare workers as it would be an imperative step in providing streamlined HIV 
      counselling services to women attending antenatal clinic in Fiji.

AB  - Biseugenol (1), a neolignan with antiprotozoal activity against Trypanosoma 
      cruzi, was partially methylated, and the compound obtained - methyl biseugenol 
      (2) - had its activity evaluated against the extracellular (trypomastigotes) and 
      intracellular (amastigotes) forms of T. cruzi. It was observed that both 
      compounds 1 and 2 exhibited similar effects against trypomastigotes (IC(50) of 
      11.7 and 16.2 μM, respectively), whereas compound 2 displayed higher activity 
      against amastigotes (IC(50) = 8.2 μM) in comparison with biseugenol 
      (IC(50) = 15.4 μM). Additionally, reduced toxicity against NCTC cells for 
      compound 2 was observed (CC(50) > 200 μM), differently from compound 1 with 
      CC(50) = 58.0 μM. Aiming to understand better the molecular mechanism of the 
      biological action of compound 2, the prodrug was incorporated into cellular 
      membrane models constituted of Langmuir monolayers of the lipids 
      dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine 
      (DPPE), dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine (DPPS), and dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol 
      (DPPG). The lipid-drug interaction was inferred through tensiometry, surface 
      potential, infrared spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). 
      The prodrug expanded DPPC and DPPG monolayers and condensed DPPE ones, as well as 
      presented characteristic behaviors regarding the chemical structure of the lipid 
      considering expansion-compression curves, surface potential-area isotherms, and 
      stability of previously compressed monolayers to relevant-biological surface 
      pressures. PM-IRRAS indicated a molecular disorder for DPPC and DPPS alkyl chains 
      in the presence of the drug. BAM revealed the presence of domains in the DPPG and 
      DPPE monolayers, which was probably induced by the prodrug. These data suggest, 
      in general, that the lipid composition modulates the interaction of compound 2, 
      whose results are expected to correlate to its trypanocidal activity, which 
      involves the plasma membrane of T. cruzi as the primary target, i.e., the first 
      barrier that the compound should encounter to interact with the microorganism.

TI  - Comparative molecular profiling of antimicrobial resistance and phylogenetic

AB  - The global spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is alarming. Escherichia coli 
      is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes healthcare-associated infections and is 
      a major threat to public health. Currently, no comprehensive antimicrobial 
      surveillance of multidrug-resistant E. coli of diverse phylogroups along the meat 
      value chain has been implemented in Higashihiroshima, Japan. Therefore, by 
      employing the One Health approach, 1183 bacterial isolates, including 303 
      recovered from meat samples in 2009, were screened for the presence of 
      antimicrobial resistance determinants using multiplex PCR and DNA sequencing 
      techniques. Seventy-seven non-duplicate E. coli isolates that harbored AMR genes 
      were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the detection of 
      integrons. Phylogenetic characterization, which has not been previously 
      investigated, was used to assign E. coli to one of the eight phylogroups. 
      Twenty-six out of 33 (78.8%) and 34 out of 44 (77.3%) E. coli isolates from 2009 
      and 2021 exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotypes, respectively. The most 
      common clinical resistance was observed against ampicillin, tetracycline, 
      kanamycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, cefotaxime, and chloramphenicol. 
      Overall, 22.1% (17/77) of the E. coli isolates carried extended-spectrum 
      β-lactamase (ESBL)-encoding genes and showed the ESBL-resistant phenotypes. For 
      the two isolation years, AmpC/ESBL prevalence decreased from 42.4% in 2009 to 
      20.5% in 2021. The identified AMR genes included bla(CTX-M-1), bla(CTX-M-2), 
      bla(CTX-M-14), bla(CTX-M-15), and bla(SHV-12) (ESBL-types); bla(SHV-1), 
      bla(TEM-1), bla(TEM-135), and bla(TEM-176) (narrow-spectrum types); bla(CMY-4), 
      bla(ADC-32), bla(ADC-216), bla(ACT-48), and bla(ACT-51) (AmpC types); and 
      integrons. All E. coli isolates were negative for carbapenemase-encoding genes, 
      whereas one isolate from 2009 carried mcr-5.1 allele. Approximately 52% of E. 
      coli isolates identified in 2009 were assigned to phylogroup A compared to the 
      20.5% in 2021. Notably, the highest proportions of E. coli phylogroups exhibiting 
      MDR were groups A, B1, and F, suggesting that members of these groups are mostly 
      associated with drug resistance. This study highlights the role of meat as a 
      significant reservoir of MDR E. coli and potential source for transmission of AMR 
      genes. Our findings emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring to track 
      the changes in the spread of antimicrobial resistance in the food chain.

AB  - Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) continues to cause foodborne 
      outbreaks associated with beef and beef products despite consistent use of 
      antimicrobial interventions. In this study, the influence of antibiotic 
      resistance (ABR) in E. coli O157:H7 H1730, O157:H7 43,895, O121:H19 and O26:H11 
      on tolerance to peroxyacetic acid (PAA) was evaluated. Further, bactericidal 
      concentrations of PAA in the presence of nutrient rich media (Tryptic Soy Broth, 
      TSB and beef exudates) and nutrient deficient media (Sterile Deionized Water, SDW 
      and Phosphate Buffered Saline, PBS) were evaluated for all bacterial strains. 
      Antibiotic resistance to ampicillin (amp C), or ampicillin and streptomycin (amp 
      P strep C) was generated in each bacterial strain through incremental exposure to 
      the antibiotics or by plasmid transformation (n = 12 total strains). The mean 
      bactericidal concentrations of PAA were higher (p ≤ 0.05) in nutrient rich media 
      (205.55 ± 31.11 in beef exudate and 195.83 ± 25.00 ppm in TSB) than in nutrient 
      deficient media (57.91 ± 11.97 ppm in SDW and 56.66 ± 9.56 ppm in PBS). Strain 
      O157: H7 ampP strepC was the most tolerant to PAA (p ≤ 0.05). At 200 ppm in 
      nutrient rich media and 60 ppm in nutrient deficient media, all bacterial strains 
      declined in population to below the limit of detection. Analysis of the beef 
      exudates indicated the presence of diverse amino acids that have been associated 
      with acid tolerance. The results from this study indicate that beef exudates 
      could contribute to acid tolerance and suggest that some STEC bacterial strains 
      with certain ABR profiles might be more tolerant to PAA.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the overall genetic diversity, as well as 
      prevalence and mechanisms of resistance to quinolone antibiotics of 178 
      Campylobacter jejuni isolated from humans, cattle, dogs, and chickens in Turkey. 
      Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and E-test were performed for genotyping and 
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing, respectively. Mismatch Amplification 
      Mutation Assay, Polymerase Chain Reaction (MAMA-PCR) was used to detect point 
      mutations associated with quinolone resistance. Of the 178 isolates tested, 151 
      were included in 21 clonal complexes (CCs); the remaining 27 isolates did not 
      belong to any existing CCs. CC21, CC353, CC206, and CC257 were the predominant 
      clones, representing 38 % of all C. jejuni isolates tested. The isolates were 
      assigned to 78 different sequence types (STs), three of which were novel (ST 
      8082, ST 8083, and ST 8084). Resistance to quinolones was found in 73 (41 %) of 
      the isolates (42.85 %, 2.85 %, 20.58 %, and 43.75 % in human, cattle, dog, and 
      chicken isolates, respectively). All of the resistant isolates had Thr-86-Ile 
      mutation in the gyrA gene. The highest Sorensen coefficient index was detected 
      for human/chicken meat and human/dog C. jejuni isolates (Ss = 0.71), suggesting a 
      strong link between the isolates from respective sources. The Simpson diversity 
      index of C. jejuni isolates analyzed was detected between 0.92 and 0.98. The 
      study provides detailed information on the quinolone resistance and MLST-based 
      genetic relatedness of C. jejuni isolates from humans, cattle, dog, and broiler 
      meat in Turkey for the first time, enabling a better understanding of the 
      transmission pathways of C. jejuni in this country. Our results suggest that 
      broiler meat and dogs may be the most important sources of human 
      campylobacteriosis in Turkey.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) have altered anticipatory postural 
      adjustments (APAs) during gait initiation. These APAs may affect dynamic balance 
      in tasks such as stepping. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: How are APAs in children with CP 
      affected during stepping to precise targets? How do children with CP modulate 
      APAs when stepping to medial and lateral targets? What is the association between 
      APAs and symptom severity, movement quality and impairment profile? METHOD: 
      Children undertook a stepping task to laterally and medially placed targets with 
      either leg, in a randomised order. Movement of the centre of pressure (COP) and 
      markers at the pelvis and foot were measured via a force plate and 3D motion 
      analysis. Motion of the centre of mass (COM) was estimated via pelvic markers. 
      APAs were assessed prior to leading leg lift-off in medio-lateral and 
      antero-posterior directions. Stepping error was calculated. Baseline 
      characteristics of children with CP included Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), 
      Quality Function Measure (QFM), leg muscle hypertonia (Tardieu test) and strength 
      (manual dynamometry). RESULTS: Sixteen ambulant children with CP (12.2 years 
      ± 2.2) and 14 typically developing (TD) children (11.6 years ± 2.9) were 
      assessed. In children with CP, APAs in the medio-lateral direction were 20-30% 
      smaller. Children with CP were less able to modulate their APAs with steps to 
      medial and laterally placed targets, than TD children. Medio-lateral COP motion 
      was associated with movement quality assessed by QFM subsections, GMFM 
      (correlation coefficient r = 0.66-0.80) and hip abductor strength (r = 0.75). 
      Antero-posterior APAs were significantly smaller when stepping with the 
      non-paretic leg in children with CP. APA size was positively related to the 
      length of the contralateral, paretic gastrocnemius (r = 0.77). Stepping error was 
      higher in children with CP and inversely correlated to the size of the 
      medio-lateral APA. DISCUSSION: Children with CP show smaller medio-lateral APAs 
      especially when stepping to medially placed targets. APA size may be limited by 
      proximal muscle strength and gastrocnemius length.

TI  - Imagine HEALTH: Changes in diurnal salivary cortisol patterns following a 12-week 
      guided imagery RCT lifestyle intervention in predominantly Latino adolescents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alterations in diurnal salivary cortisol patterns have been linked to 
      adverse metabolic health outcomes. We have previously shown that stress-reduction 
      guided imagery (GI) can reduce salivary cortisol levels acutely. We now ask 
      whether addition of GI into a 12-week lifestyle intervention designed to improve 
      eating and physical activity behaviors can alter diurnal salivary cortisol 
      patterns and perceived stress. METHODS: 232 adolescent participants (ages 14-17 
      years) were cluster randomized by school into one of four intervention arms: 
      non-intervention Control (C; n = 51), Lifestyle (LS; n=61), Stress-Reduction GI 
      (SRGI; n = 55), and Lifestyle Behavior GI (LBGI; n = 65). LS group received one 
      nutrition and one physical activity class per week after-school for 12 weeks. 
      SRGI and LBGI groups received same LS classes plus an additional weekly GI 
      session. Salivary cortisol was assessed pre- and post-intervention on 3 days, 3 
      times daily, at awakening, 30-minutes post-awakening, and in the evening to 
      determine Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and Diurnal Cortisol Slope (DCS). 
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was administered pre- and post-intervention. Mixed 
      effects modeling was used for intent-to-treat analysis and sensitivity analysis 
      was used for those participants adherent to intervention protocol. RESULTS: 
      Analysis of 208 subjects with complete data showed a small between-group increase 
      in CAR in LBGI vs C (p = 0.045, d=0.24), with no significant group differences 
      among other intervention arms. There were no between group differences in change 
      in DCS or change in PSS after 12-weeks. Amongst adherent participants, LBGI 
      showed a small-moderate increase in CAR (p = 0.03, d=0.37), and moderate-large 
      reduction in PSS (p = 0.02, d=-0.66) compared to C. There were no other between 
      group differences in CAR, DCS, or PSS. CONCLUSION: LBGI led to an increase in 
      CAR, and in adherent subjects, a decrease in PSS, suggesting GI may be a 
      mind-body intervention that can affect both objective and subjective measures of 
      the stress response. Whether changes in cortisol patterns in this population 
      affect measures of mental or physical health remains to be determined.

AB  - Lokivetmab (Cytopoint®, Zoetis) is a canine monoclonal antibody that specifically 
      binds and neutralizes interleukin (IL)-31. Lokivetmab is approved for use in dogs 
      for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) and allergic dermatitis. The 
      laboratory safety of lokivetmab was evaluated in 2 studies by adapting the 
      science-based, case-by-case approach used for preclinical and early clinical 
      safety evaluation of human biopharmaceuticals. The main objectives were to 
      demonstrate the safety of lokivetmab in healthy laboratory Beagle dogs by using 
      integrated clinical, morphologic, and functional evaluations. In Study 1, dogs 
      were treated s.c. with saline or lokivetmab at 3.3 mg/kg (1X, label dose) or 
      10 mg/kg (3X intended dose) for 7 consecutive monthly doses, with terminal 
      pathology and histology assessments. In Study 2, the functional immune response 
      was demonstrated in naïve dogs using the T-cell dependent antibody response 
      (TDAR) test with 2 different dose levels of unadjuvanted keyhole limpet 
      hemocyanin (KLH) as the model immunogen. The primary endpoint was anti-KLH IgG 
      antibody titer, and secondary endpoints were ex vivo IL-2 enzyme-linked 
      immunospot (ELISpot) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell lymphoproliferation 
      assays. Both studies included monitoring general health, periodic veterinary 
      clinical evaluations, serial clinical pathology and toxicokinetics, and 
      monitoring for anti-drug antibodies. In both studies, the health of dogs 
      receiving lokivetmab was similar to controls, with no treatment-related changes 
      uncovered. Extensive pathology evaluations of immune tissues (Study 1) revealed 
      no lokivetmab-related morphologic changes, and in dogs treated at 10 mg/kg 
      lokivetmab, immunization with the model antigen KLH did not impair the functional 
      antibody or T-cell recall responses. There were no immunogenicity-related or 
      hypersensitivity-related responses observed in either study. These studies in 
      healthy laboratory dogs showed that lokivetmab was well-tolerated, did not 
      produce any treatment-related effects, and had no effect on immune system 
      morphology or its functional response. These studies also demonstrated the 
      utility of a science-based case-by-case approach to the safety evaluation of a 
      veterinary biopharmaceutical product.

      The ECM is a three-dimensional network of large molecules consisting of a variety 
      of proteins. It is a physical scaffold for organs, and all types of cells can be 
      found within the ECM. The testicle, where sperm are produced, is an organ that is 
      constantly in dynamic flux. Metalloproteinases can regulate testicular tissue 
      development and the maturation of sperm by affecting the ECM. Metalloproteinase 
      disorders can lead to cryptorchidism, azoospermia, poor semen quality and other 
      diseases. As a member of the metalloproteinase family, ADAMTS plays an important 
      role in testicular slippage to the scrotum. ADAM is involved in the fertilization 
      process, and excessive MMP can damage the BTB. In the testis, metalloproteinase 
      stability represents the stability of the extracellular microenvironment in which 
      germ cells are located and is associated with reproductive function. 
      Metalloproteinases have a definite relationship with male reproduction, but the 
      underlying mechanism is still unclear. This paper summarizes the literature on 
      various metalloproteinases in testicular tissue physiology and pathology to 
      elucidate their role in reproductive function and male reproductive mechanisms.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many complexity metrics characterize modulated plans. First, this 
      study aimed at identify the optimal complexity metrics to reduce workload 
      associated to patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) for our equipment and 
      processes. Second, it intended to optimize our MLC modelling to improve 
      measurement and calculation agreement with expectation of further reducing PSQA 
      workload. METHODS: Correlation and sensitivity at specificity equals to 1 were 
      evaluated for PSQA results and different complexity metrics. Thresholds to stop 
      PSQA were determined. After validation of the optimal complexity metric and 
      threshold for our equipment and process, the MLC modelling was reviewed with a 
      recently published methodology. This method is based on measurements with a 
      Farmer-type ionization chamber of synchronous and asynchronous sweeping gap 
      plans. Effect on the PSQA results and the identified threshold was investigated. 
      RESULTS: In our center, the most appropriate complexity metric for reducing our 
      PSQA workload was the Modulation Complexity Score for VMAT (MCSv). The 
      optimization of the MLC modelling significantly reduced the number of controlled 
      plans, specifically for one of our two Varian Clinac. Any plan with a MCSv >= 
      0.34 is treated without PSQA. CONCLUSION: This study rationalized and reduced our 
      PSQA workload by approximately 30%. It is a continuing work with new TPS, machine 
      or PSQA equipment. It encourages centers to re-evaluate their MLC modelling as 
      well as assess the benefit of complexity metrics to streamline their PSQA 
      workflow. An easier access, at least for reporting, at best for optimizing plans, 
      into the TPS would be beneficial for the community.

AB  - PURPOSE: To establish automated quality assurance (QA) procedures for the 
      kilovoltage (kV) and the Megavoltage (MV) imagers of two linear accelerators 
      (LINACS) using a commercial software. METHODS: SNC Machine™ phantoms and software 
      were used and the baseline values, tolerance and action levels for various image 
      quality parameters were defined. Scaling, spatial resolution, contrast, 
      uniformity and noise were considered, explored and evaluated utilizing the 
      appropriate phantoms and the accompanying software. kV and MV planar radiographic 
      images, for 6MV and 10MV beams were obtained for each LINAC. For both kV and MV 
      QA tasks, the baseline values for spatial resolution, contrast, uniformity and 
      noise were defined. RESULTS: Subsequent measurements performed were highly 
      reproducible and within tolerance and action levels, while noise showed 
      variations. The calculated tolerance and action levels for noise were looser 
      compared to the other image quality metrics. CONCLUSIONS: An automated QA 
      workflow of the kV and MV planar radiographic mode of LINAC imagers' was 
      established and appears to be time effective.

AB  - Successful in-vitro production of bovine embryos relies on meiotic maturation of 
      oocytes in vitro (IVM) before they can be fertilised. High levels of IVM are 
      currently achieved using a complex medium that contains all 20 common amino 
      acids, namely TCM199, but can also be achieved using a simple inorganic salt 
      solution containing non-essential amino acids, proline, and glutamine. Further 
      simplification of the amino acid content of medium used for IVM could lead to a 
      more defined medium that provides reproducible IVM. The aim of this study was, 
      therefore, to determine the minimal amino acid requirements for bovine oocyte 
      nuclear maturation, as measured by progression to metaphase II (MII) of meiosis. 
      Supplementation of a simple medium composed of inorganic salts (M1 medium) with 
      multiple amino-acid combinations showed that M1 containing glutamine, proline, 
      and isoleucine resulted in nuclear maturation comparable to that of TCM199 
      (57.4 ± 3.4% vs 67% ± 1.7%, respectively) but was reduced when cystine (Cys2) to 
      that seen with M1 alone (38.0 ± 2.2%). Viability of oocytes matured in this 
      simplified medium was equal to those matured in TCM199 since the same proportion 
      of zygotes with 2 pronuclei were observed following fertilisation in medium 
      containing no amino acids (33.9 ± 6.5% vs 33.3 ± 3.6%, respectively). Addition of 
      glutamine, proline and isoleucine to fertilisation medium also increased the 
      proportion of zygotes but did not increase blastocyst development rates. Thus, a 
      defined medium containing only glutamine, proline and isoleucine is sufficient 
      for oocyte maturation and successful fertilisation.

AB  - RF-amide related peptides (RFRP) have been proposed as critical regulators of 
      gonadotropin secretion in mammals. This study was designed to construct a DNA 
      vaccine and investigate the effect of vaccine encoding RFRP-3 on reproduction 
      physiology in ewe. A recombinant vaccine was constructed using two copies of the 
      RFRP-3 gene and HBsAg-S that generate a fusion protein to induce an immunology 
      response. Results showed this recombinant vaccine could produce a significant 
      antibody titer in the treated animals (P < 0.05). The specific RFRP-3 antibody 
      response induced by the vaccine was detected at week 2 with a peak at week 6 
      after the initial immunization. Furthermore, we found that ewes inoculated with 
      pVAX-tPA-HBsAg-S-2RFRP-asd vaccine significantly raised the concentration of 
      GnRH, LH and E(2) in serum compared to the control group. LH and E2 concentration 
      in the treated ewes (Group T) was significantly higher than that in control ewes 
      (Group C) at weeks 10, 12 and 14 after the initial immunization, respectively 
      (P < 0.05). Therefore, RFRP-3 can be used as a target for DNA immunization to 
      promote reproductive hormone secretion in ewes and RFRP-3 gene immunization might 
      be a candidate tool to regulate mammal reproduction.

AB  - Fertility of recipient beef cows with subclinical endometritis (SCE) that did or 
      did not receive flunixin meglumine (FM) treatment were compared following 
      transfer of d 7 embryo. The study population comprised of 600 Angus cross cows 
      that expressed estrus following Select-Synch + CIDR (Controlled Internal Drug 
      Release) estrus synchronization protocol. At the time of embryo transfer, 
      approximately 3 wk after sampling for subclinical endometritis, cows were 
      randomly allocated either to receive FM treatment (500 mg of Banamine®; n = 300) 
      or not (Control; n = 300). The effect of subclinical endometritis (at ≥ 1% PMN on 
      endometrial cytology by cytobrush method) and FM treatment on pregnancy/embryo 
      transfer (P/ET, %) were evaluated by mixed model. Of the 600 cows, 323 (53.8%) 
      became pregnant; 55.0% (165/300) cows that received FM treatment vs. 52.7% 
      (158/300) control cows (P > 0.1), and 55.9% (266/476) normal vs. 46.0% (57/124) 
      subclinical endometritis cows (P < 0.05). There was a trend for treatment by 
      subclinical endometritis for P/ET (P = 0.09). Pregnancy was recorded in 55.3% 
      (134/242) of normal and 53.4% (31/58) of subclinical endometritis cows that 
      received FM treatment, and in 56.4% (132/234) of normal and 39.4% (26/66) of 
      subclinical endometritis cows that did not receive FM treatment (P = 0.09). In 
      conclusion, subclinical endometritis in recipient beef cows resulted in lower 
      P/ET. Though not significant in cows with subclinical endometritis, FM treatment 
      resulted in 14.0% points more pregnancy compared with control.

AB  - This study explored the application value of "Internet +" pharmacy service on 
      psychiatric hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic. During the epidemic, as of 
      December 31, 2020, the number of online pharmacist consultations increased to 149 
      cases (82.78 %). At the same time, patients had various types of consultation 
      questions, mainly involving adverse drug reactions, drug selection, usage and 
      dosage, persistence of long-term medication, drug distribution, etc. Due to the 
      particularity of psychiatric hospital, pharmaceutical consultation services 
      mainly focus on nervous system drugs. The results indicated that the demand for 
      "Internet +" pharmaceutical consultation services has increased significantly 
      during the COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative periprosthetic fracture (IF) is an under-reported 
      complication in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study aimed to audit 
      the outcomes and complication rates in patients encountering IF during primary 
      TKA and propose a new classification for its management. METHODS: A nested 
      case-control study was performed at a tertiary referral hospital where 50 
      patients encountering IF during primary TKA operated by a single surgeon team 
      between January 2016 to May 2021, were compared with 150 (3:1) age-, gender- and 
      implant-matched patients not encountering IF. Demographic data, risk factors, 
      outcomes and complications of both groups were compared at a minimum follow up of 
      1 year. RESULTS: The incidence of IF was 0.45%, with 44 fractures in the femur 
      (88%), six (12%) in the tibia and none in the patella. Medial collateral ligament 
      avulsion fracture (54.54%) in the femur and medial plateau fracture (66.66%) in 
      the tibia were the most common fracture types. At final follow up, the fracture 
      group had higher rates of 90-day re-admissions (8% vs. 2.66%, P = 0.095), deep 
      infection (4% vs. 0.66%, P = 0.15) and revisions (6% vs. 1.33%, P = 0.06). The 
      mean Knee Society Score was not significantly different between the two groups 
      (152.22 ± 9.25 vs. 161.68 ± 11.22, P = 0.642) with union being achieved in all 
      but one patient at a mean duration of 9.6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 
      severe and fixed deformities have a higher risk for IF. The occurrence of 
      fracture and the complexity of surgery equally contribute to the higher 
      complication rates. Appropriately managed fractures have comparable functional 
      outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower proteoglycan density, as estimated by greater T1ρ magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) relaxation times, may be an indicator of early 
      osteoarthritis development. We examined associations between femoral cartilage 
      inter-limb T1ρ MRI relaxation time ratios and clinically relevant knee symptoms 
      at 12 months following anterior crucial ligament reconstruction (ACLR). METHODS: 
      Twenty-nine individuals completed the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) 
      and underwent MRI 12 months following ACLR for this cross-sectional study. 
      Participants were categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic for clinically 
      relevant knee symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis based on a standard KOOS 
      classification. T1ρ MRI relaxation times were segmented in the weightbearing 
      regions of lateral and medial femoral condyle (LFC and MFC). Inter-limb T1ρ MRI 
      relaxation time ratios were calculated by normalizing the ACLR to the uninjured 
      knee. T-tests were used to compare LFC and MFC interlimb T1ρ relaxation time 
      ratios between individuals with and without knee symptoms. A Receiver Operating 
      Characteristic (ROC) Curve analysis was used to determine a critical inter-limb 
      T1ρ relaxation time ratio identifying symptomatic patients. Odds ratios (OR) and 
      95% confidence intervals (CI) estimated the association between the critical 
      value and clinically relevant knee symptoms. RESULTS: Symptomatic individuals had 
      significantly higher LFC inter-limb T1ρ MRI relaxation time ratios compared to 
      asymptomatic individuals (p = 0.04). Individuals with an LFC inter-limb T1ρ MRI 
      relaxation time ratio >1.11 were more likely to have symptoms (OR 8.5; 
      95%CI = 1.25-57.93). CONCLUSION: Individuals with greater inter-limb LFC T1ρ MRI 
      relaxation time ratios 12 months post-ACLR may be more likely to exhibit symptoms 
      consistent with knee OA.

AB  - In the infection cycle, viruses release their genome in the host cell during 
      uncoating. Here we use a variety of physicochemical procedures to induce and 
      monitor the in vitro uncoating of ssDNA from individual Minute Virus of Mice 
      (MVM) particles. Our experiments revealed two pathways of genome release: i) 
      filamentous ssDNA appearing around intact virus particles when using gradual 
      mechanical fatigue and heating at moderate temperature (50 °C). ii) thick 
      structures of condensed ssDNA appearing when the virus particle is disrupted by 
      mechanical nanoindentations, denaturing agent guanidinium chloride and high 
      temperature (70 °C). We propose that in the case of filamentous ssDNA, when the 
      capsid integrity is conserved, the genome is externalized through one channel of 
      the capsid pores. However, the disruption of virus particles revealed a native 
      structure of condensed genome. The mechanical analysis of intact particles after 
      DNA strands ejection confirm the stabilization role of ssDNA in MVM.

AB  - HnRNP K is a well-known member of HnRNP family proteins that has been implicated 
      in the regulation of protein expression. Currently, the impact of HnRNP K on the 
      reproduction cycle of a broad range of virus were reported, while the precise 
      function for PRRSV was lacking. In this study, we determined that both PRRSV 
      infection and ectopic expression of N protein induced an enrichment of HnRNP K in 
      the cytoplasm. Using RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation, we described the 
      interactions between the KH2 domain of HnRNP K and cytosine-rich sequences (CRS) 
      in PRRSV genomic RNA corresponding to Nsp7α coding region. Meanwhile, 
      overexpression of HnRNP K inhibited viral gene expression and PRRSV replication, 
      while silencing of HnRNP K resulted in an increased in virus yield. Taken 
      together, this study assists in the understanding of PRRSV-host interactions, and 
      the development of vaccines based on viral genome engineering.

AB  - HIV can establish a long-lived latent infection in cells harboring integrated 
      non-expressing proviruses. Latency reversing agents (LRAs), including protein 
      kinase C (PKC) modulators, can induce expression of latent HIV, thereby reducing 
      the latent reservoir in animal models. However, PKC modulators such as 
      bryostatin-1 also cause cytokine upregulation in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs), including cytokines that might independently reverse HIV latency. 
      To determine whether cytokines induced by PKC modulators contribute to latency 
      reversal, primary human PBMCs were treated with bryostatin-1 or the bryostatin 
      analog SUW133, a superior LRA, and supernatant was collected. As anticipated, 
      LRA-treated cell supernatant contained increased levels of cytokines compared to 
      untreated cell supernatant. However, exposure of latently-infected cells with 
      this supernatant did not result in latency reactivation. These results indicate 
      that PKC modulators do not have significant indirect effects on HIV latency 
      reversal in vitro and thus are targeted in their latency reversing ability.

AB  - G12C mutant KRas is considered druggable by allele-specific covalent inhibitors 
      due to the nucleophilic character of the oncogenic mutant cysteine at position 
      12. Discovery of these inhibitors requires the optimization of both covalent and 
      noncovalent interactions. Here, we report covalent fragment screening of our 
      electrophilic fragment library of diverse non-covalent scaffolds equipped with 40 
      different electrophilic functionalities to identify fragments as suitable 
      starting points targeting Cys12. Screening the library against KRas(G12C) using 
      Ellman's free thiol assay, followed by protein NMR and cell viability assays, 
      resulted in two potential inhibitor chemotypes. Characterization of these 
      scaffolds in in vitro cellular- and in vivo xenograft models revealed them as 
      promising starting points for covalent drug discovery programs.

AB  - Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) has been considered as an attractive target 
      for oncology immunotherapy due to its immunosuppressive effects on the tumor 
      microenvironment. The most advanced IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat in combination 
      with anti-PD-1 antibody failed to show desirable objective response. Epacadostat 
      is now reevaluated in phase III clinical trials, but its pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      properties are unsatisfactory. To further unravel the antitumor efficacy of IDO1 
      inhibitors, we designed a series of epacadostat analogues by introducing various 
      urea-containing side chains. In particular, the most active compound 3 showed 
      superior inhibitory potency against recombinant hIDO1 and hIDO1 in HeLa cells 
      induced by interferon γ (IFNγ) relative to epacadostat (3, biochemical hIDO1 
      IC(50) = 67.4 nM, HeLa hIDO1 IC(50) = 17.6 nM; epacadostat, biochemical hIDO1 
      IC(50) = 75.9 nM, HeLa hIDO1 IC(50) = 20.6 nM). Moreover, compound 3 exhibited 
      improved physicochemical properties and rat PK profile with better oral exposure 
      and bioavailability compared with epacadostat. Importantly, this compound 
      exhibited comparable antitumor efficacy with epacadostat in LLC syngeneic 
      xenograft models. Hence, compound 3 represents a promising lead compound for 
      discovery of more effective IDO1 inhibitors.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare liver fat quantification between MRI and photon-counting CT 
      (PCCT). METHOD: A cylindrical phantom with inserts containing six concentrations 
      of oil (0, 10, 20, 30, 50 and 100%) and oil-iodine mixtures (0, 10, 20, 30 and 
      50% fat +3 mg/mL iodine) was imaged with a PCCT (NAEOTOM Alpha) and a 1.5 T MRI 
      system (MR 450w, IDEAL-IQ sequence), using clinical parameters. An IRB-approved 
      prospective clinical evaluation included 12 obese adult patients with known fatty 
      liver disease (seven women, mean age: 61.5 ± 13 years, mean BMI: 
      30.3 ± 4.7 kg/m(2)). Patients underwent a same-day clinical MRI and PCCT of the 
      abdomen. Liver fat fractions were calculated for four segments (I, II, IVa and 
      VII) using in- and opposed-phase on MRI ((Mean(in) - Mean(opp))/2*Mean(in)) and 
      iodine-fat, tissue decomposition analysis in PCCT (Syngo.Via VB60A). CT and MRI 
      Fat fractions were compared using two-sample t-tests with equal variance. 
      Statistical analysis was performed using RStudio (Version1.4.1717). RESULTS: 
      Phantom results showed no significant differences between the known fat fractions 
      (P = 0.32) or iodine (P = 0.6) in comparison to PCCT-measured concentrations, and 
      no statistically significant difference between known and MRI-measured fat 
      fractions (P = 0.363). In patients, the mean fat signal fraction measured on MRI 
      and PCCT was 13.1 ± 9.9% and 12.0 ± 9.0%, respectively, with an average 
      difference of 1.1 ± 1.9% between the modalities (P = 0.138). CONCLUSION: First 
      experience shows promising accuracy of liver fat fraction quantification for PCCT 
      in obese patients. This method may improve opportunistic screening for CT in the 
      future.

AB  - How to generate a brain of correct size and with appropriate cell-type diversity 
      during development is a major question in Neuroscience. In the developing 
      neocortex, radial glial progenitor (RGP) cells are the main neural stem cells 
      that produce cortical excitatory projection neurons, glial cells, and establish 
      the prospective postnatal stem cell niche in the lateral ventricles. RGPs follow 
      a tightly orchestrated developmental program that when disrupted can result in 
      severe cortical malformations such as microcephaly and megalencephaly. The 
      precise cellular and molecular mechanisms instructing faithful RGP lineage 
      progression are however not well understood. This review will summarize recent 
      conceptual advances that contribute to our understanding of the general 
      principles of RGP lineage progression.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two global epidemics that 
      share several metabolic defects, such as insulin resistance, impaired glucose 
      metabolism, and mitochondrial defects. Importantly, strong evidence demonstrates 
      that T2D significantly increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, 
      particularly AD. Here, we provide an overview of the metabolic defects that 
      characterize and link both pathologies putting the focus on mitochondria. The 
      biomarker potential of mitochondrial components and the therapeutic potential of 
      some drugs that target and modulate mitochondria are also briefly discussed.

AB  - Due to relatively lower toxicity, bisphenol S (BPS) has become an alternative to 
      previously used bisphenol A. Nevertheless, the occurrence of BPS and its 
      ecological impact have recently attracted increasing attentions because the 
      toxicology effect of BPS with life cycle or multigenerational exposure on aquatic 
      organisms remains questionable. Herein, Daphnia magna (D. magna) 
      multigenerational bioassays spanning four generations (F0-F3) and 
      single-generation recovery (F1 and F3) in clean water were used to investigate 
      the ecotoxicology of variable chronic BPS exposure. For both assays, four kinds 
      of life-history traits (i.e., survival, reproduction, growth and ecological 
      behavior) were examined for each generation. After an 18-day exposure under 
      concentration of 200 μg/L, the survival rate of D. magna was less than 15 % for 
      the F2 generation, whereas all died for the F3 generation. With continuous 
      exposure of four generations of D. magna at environmentally relevant 
      concentrations of BPS (2 μg/L), inhibition of growth and development, prolonged 
      sexual maturity, decreased offspring production and decreased swimming activity 
      were observed for the F3 generation. In particular, it is difficult for D. magna 
      to return to its normal level through a single-generation recovery in clean water 
      in terms of reproductive function, ecological behavior and population health. 
      Hence, multi-generational exposure to low concentrations of BPS can have adverse 
      effects on population health of aquatic organisms with short breeding cycles, 
      highlighting the necessity to assess the ecotoxicology of chronic BPS exposure 
      for public health.

AB  - The soil contamination caused by the discharge of cadmium (Cd) from coal mining 
      activities has aroused continuous attention due to the detrimental effects on the 
      human health. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics on distribution 
      of Cd in soils and its accumulation in wheat grains under wheat-cultivation 
      system, and further assess the human health risks to adults and children. 58 
      soils and wheat samples in pairs from Linhuan coal mining area, Anhui Province 
      were collected and analyzed. Results showed that the concentrations of Cd in 
      17.24% of soil samples exceeded the limit value established by the Ministry of 
      Ecology and Environment. The ordinary kriging interpolation displayed that the 
      spatial variability of Cd concentrations in soils was mainly influenced by coal 
      mining activities. The transfer capacity of Cd from soils to wheat roots was 
      greater than that from the wheat roots to grains. Multiple linear regression 
      model clarified that soil pH and exchangeable Cd fraction in soils were the 
      critical factors affecting the Cd accumulation in wheat grains. The carcinogenic 
      risk of Cd levels in our studied wheat grains was a concern but still within the 
      acceptable range, while their non-carcinogenic hazard was negligible for adults 
      and children. The calculation results were in accord with the uncertainty 
      analysis conclusion based on Monte Carlo simulation. The study was expected to 
      promote the source management and control strategy of reducing tailing discharge, 
      and providing scientific references for current soil remediation and land 
      degradation prevention.

AB  - Patient-derived tumor organoids have considerable potential as an in vitro 
      diagnostic tool for drug susceptibility testing. In the present study, we 
      investigated whether bile collected for diagnostic purposes could be a potential 
      source for the establishment of biliary cancer organoids. Among 68 cases of 
      biliary cancer, we successfully generated 60 bile-derived organoids (BDOs) from 
      individual patients. Consistent with previous reports that described biliary 
      cancer organoids from surgical tissues, the BDOs showed diverse morphologies such 
      as simple cysts, multiloculated cysts, thick capsulated cysts, and solid masses. 
      They also harbored mutations in KRAS and TP53 at frequencies of 15% and 55%, 
      respectively. To enrich the cancer organoids by removing contaminated 
      noncancerous components of BDOs, we attempted to verify the effectiveness of 3 
      different procedures, including repeat passage, xenografting, and selection with 
      an MDM2 inhibitor for TP53 mutation-harboring BDOs. By monitoring the sequence 
      and expression of mutated TP53, we found that all these procedures successfully 
      enriched the cancer organoids. Our data suggest that BDOs can be established with 
      minimal invasiveness from almost all patients with biliary cancers, including 
      inoperable cases. Thus, despite some limitations with respect to the 
      characterization of BDOs and methods for the enrichment of cancer cell-derived 
      organoids, our data suggest that BDOs have potential applications in personalized 
      medicine.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are found in every ocean and are frequently ingested by 
      marine animals. This study analyzed MPs in the stomachs and intestines of 12 
      large marine animals comprising one fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), seven 
      finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis), two loggerhead turtles (Caretta 
      caretta), one Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), and one common 
      dolphin (Delphinus delphis) that were stranded off the Republic of Korea between 
      2019 and 2021. MPs were detected with a mean abundance of 3.42 ± 3.2 items/g and 
      were predominantly of transparent-white, fragment-shaped polypropylene smaller 
      than 200 μm. The abundance of MPs found did not correlate with the biological 
      information (maturity, body length) of the finless porpoises and there were no 
      significant differences in the abundance of MPs between the stomachs and 
      intestines. These results cannot accurately assess the impact of MPs on large 
      marine animals, so further studies are necessary to understand how MPs can 
      potentially affect them.

AB  - Dimethylsulphide is a dominant biogenic sulphur anti-greenhouse gas produced by 
      marine phytoplankton. A non-axenic culture of Skeletonema costatum was studied to 
      comprehend the effects of different growth stages and light stress on DMSP/DMS 
      production. The intracellular DMSP concentration increased during late 
      exponential to mid-stationary phase and attained a maximum (0.59 pg S cell(-1)) 
      during the stationary phase, indicating more contribution from actively dividing 
      smaller cells. Likewise, exposure to first light after a 12-hour dark phase 
      caused stress, invariably leading to elevated levels of DMS (~9 fold). These 
      observations were upheld by additional laboratory and field experiments, and a 
      field time-series observation, which recorded higher DMS concentrations during 
      exposure to first light after a dark cycle and during early mornings, 
      respectively. While our study depicts the variable DMSP and DMS concentrations 
      during different growth stages of S. costatum, it gives new information on the 
      effect of light stress on DMS production.

AB  - Aquatic pollution derived from metal presence in the Galapagos Islands could 
      affect biodiversity and human health. This research provide a baseline on food 
      safety in commercial fish species of the Galapagos Islands. We sampled muscle 
      tissue of pelagic (Acanthocybium solandri) and demersal (Caulolatilus affinis, 
      Pontinus clemensi, Hyporthodus mystacinus, and Paralabrax albomaculatus) species. 
      Metal and metalloid concentrations per species were analyzed by Inductively 
      Coupled Plasma Optical Spectrometry (ICP-OES). According to the Food and 
      Agriculture Organization (FAO) regulation none of the studied species should be 
      ingested; and according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regulation, 
      all the studied species were above the Maximum Allowable Concentration (MAC) for 
      Cd. According to EFSA, C. affinis should not be commercialized. Finally, A. 
      solandri, P. clemensi and H. mystacinus do not represent a human health risk 
      since its Margen of Safety (MoS) < 1 for people of up to 100 kg of body weight.

AB  - Microplastics contamination poses a serious threat to marine biota, so the 
      current study was carried out to assess the incidence of microplastics in the 
      gastrointestinal tracts of pelagic and benthic species collected from the six 
      sampling sites along Thoothukudi region from January 2021 to December 2021. In 
      the present study, benthic species (0.67 ± 0.14 MPs/indiv) showed a higher 
      abundance of microplastics than pelagic species (0.53 ± 0.11 MPs/indiv). The 
      dominance of microplastic shapes, sizes, colours and polymers found were 
      comparable among both pelagic and benthic species, this being fibre (27.56% and 
      48.33%), 0.5-1mm (39.78% and 42.94%), blue (50% and 40.85%), and PE (46.24% and 
      48.18%), respectively. The present study showed that microplastics are ubiquitous 
      in both habitats, which raises serious concerns for public health. Hence, 
      measures focusing on reducing local emissions and plastic waste disposal should 
      be implemented to control microplastic pollution in the marine environment.

AB  - In April 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic changed human behaviour worldwide, creating 
      an increased demand for plastic, especially single-use plastic in the form of 
      personal protective equipment. The pandemic also provided a unique situation for 
      plastic pollution studies, especially microplastic studies. This study looks at 
      the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and three national lockdowns on microplastic 
      abundance at five sites along the river Thames, UK, compared to pre-Covid-19 
      levels. This study took place from May 2019-May 2021, with 3-L water samples 
      collected monthly from each site starting at Teddington and ending at 
      Southend-on-Sea. A total of 4480 pieces, the majority of fibres (82.1 %), were 
      counted using light microscopy. Lockdown 2 (November 2020) had the highest 
      average microplastic total (27.1 L(-1)). A total of 691 pieces were identified 
      via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Polyvinyl chloride (36.19 %) 
      made up the most microplastics identified. This study documents changes in 
      microplastic abundance before, during and after the Covid-19 pandemic, an 
      unprecedented event, as well as documenting microplastic abundance along the 
      river Thames from 2019 to 2021.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Purpura fulminans (PF) is a rare syndrome of cutaneous purpura 
      which is the consequence of severe circulatory shock causing intravascular 
      thrombosis, haemorrhagic necrosis, and consequent tissue loss. The aim of this 
      study was to present our 16-year experience of managing PF in a regional burns 
      centre. METHODS: We performed a single-centre retrospective case series of all 
      patients admitted to the St Andrews Burns Centre at Broomfield Hospital, 
      Chelmsford, Essex, UK, between June 2006 and July 2022 with a diagnosis of PF. 
      Data were extracted by retrospectively searching hospital case notes. RESULTS: 
      Thirteen individuals were identified [five children (mean age 5, range 1-14) and 
      eight adults (mean age 39, range 24-54)]. The total body surface area of 
      cutaneous necrosis ranged from 5% to 80%, with a mean of 27.2%. Patients were 
      treated with an established surgical sequence of total wound debridement and 
      immediate coverage with a cadaveric allograft, followed by staged wound 
      autografting. The mean time from disease onset to wound autografting was 37.3 
      days (range 20-64 days). Eight individuals (61.6%) required major amputation of 
      at least one limb (proximal to the ankle or wrist joint). Only one mortality (of 
      80% total body surface area skin loss) was observed in the identified cohort. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The large body surface areas often involved in PF cases make 
      management of these wounds well suited for burns centres, wherein established 
      facilities and multidisciplinary teams exist that are familiar with managing 
      large cutaneous burns. We provide a suggested algorithm to aid the management of 
      PF.

AB  - Cognitive skill learning (CSL) refers to the capacity to improve performance on 
      specific cognitive operations through repeated practice. We hypothesized that 
      high CSL aptitude may promote accumulation of cognitive reserve, and resiliency 
      to cognitive decline, in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Using an adaptive 
      working memory training paradigm, we obtained CSL aptitude indices (amount of 
      improvement on the training task over time) in MS patients for a single session 
      of practice (25-30 min), and longer-term practice (twenty sessions). 
      Neuropsychological performance was assessed with the Symbol Digit Modalities Test 
      (SDMT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), and the Raven's Advanced 
      Progressive Matrices (RAPM). CSL aptitude measures were positively correlated 
      with neuropsychological performance, and had high diagnostic accuracy for 
      classifying cognitive impairment in MS, defined as 1.5 SD below the 
      demographics-corrected normative mean of the SDMT. Positive relationships between 
      CSL aptitude measures and neuropsychological performance tended to be more 
      pronounced for individuals with high estimated cognitive reserve, suggesting that 
      high CSL aptitude is a a factor that promotes the protective effects of cognitive 
      reserve. Furthermore, regression analyses indicated that CSL aptitude is 
      separable from baseline cognitive capacity. The findings suggest that CSL 
      aptitude impacts the neuropsychological profile in MS, and may be a factor 
      underlying variance in cognitive resiliency.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vaccination is a key strategy to limit the impact of the COVID-19 
      pandemic, among vulnerable groups such as cancer patients. However, COVID-19 
      vaccine hesitancy is limiting vaccination uptake in this population as in others. 
      This study aimed to synthesise the emerging literature on vaccine hesitancy in 
      this population and in Oncology health professionals, reasons for and factors 
      associated with hesitancy, and interventions that address hesitancy. METHODS: A 
      rapid review was undertaken PubMed, Ovid and Google across all years up to 
      October 2021 for articles in English, from any country or region, addressing the 
      above issues. Individual case studies, opinion pieces, commentary articles and 
      conference abstracts were excluded. Article screening, data extraction and bias 
      assessment were conducted by two authors. A narrative synthesis of the data was 
      undertaken. RESULTS: Eighteen eligible articles were identified. Reported 
      COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rates varied from 76.7 % to 3.9 %, with a mean of 
      38.4 %. A large international study (n > 20,000) reported a more conservative 
      hesitancy rate of 19 %. Six broad, common reasons for hesitancy were identified. 
      Oncologist advice was valued by patients. DISCUSSION: Vaccine hesitancy remains a 
      significant concern in the oncology context. Oncologists are key to addressing 
      hesitancy and providing tailored advice to cancer patients. PRACTICE 
      IMPLICATIONS: Where possible, patients appreciate personalised, tailored 
      information about vaccination which addresses its interaction with cancer and its 
      treatment. Education programmes for oncologists to support effective 
      communication in this context are needed. Webinars and peer-to-peer counselling 
      may be useful but remain to be proven.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to verify the performance of the 
      triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index in predicting metabolic syndrome (MetS) using 
      three different criteria in healthy individuals living in rural areas. In 
      addition, it aimed to estimate the TyG index cutoff point in the prediction of 
      MetS. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional study of healthy individuals (aged 
      ≥18 y) living in rural areas of southern Brazil. Individuals with diabetes 
      mellitus were excluded. The variables investigated were waist circumference, 
      blood pressure, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting 
      glucose, and TyG index. MetS was defined using three criteria: harmonized, 
      International Diabetes Foundation, and National Cholesterol Education Program 
      Adult Treatment Panel III. The Poisson regression model was used for the 
      multivariate analysis. The performance of the TyG index in identifying MetS was 
      determined by receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: A total of 133 
      individuals were included in this study, with a mean age of 49.0 ± 13.5 y; 54.1% 
      were female. The TyG index performed better in predicting MetS through the 
      harmonized criteria, with area under the curve (AUC) = 0.889 (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.829-0.949), followed by the International Diabetes Foundation 
      criteria, with AUC = 0.877 (95% CI, 0.814-0.940), and the National Cholesterol 
      Education Program criteria, with AUC = 0.867 (95% CI, 0.797-0.937). The TyG index 
      cutoff points defined for the harmonized and International Diabetes Foundation 
      criteria were ≥ 8.61, and ≥ 8.79 for the National Cholesterol Education Program 
      Adult Treatment Panel III. CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index proved to be valid for 
      diagnosing MetS. The largest AUC of the TyG index was identified for the 
      harmonized criteria. Thus, the TyG index can be used to diagnose MetS in 
      individuals living in rural areas.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A study was carried out to identify characteristics of consumers of 
      dairy products. METHODS: Based on a questionnaire with 127 participants, aged 22 
      to 52, a simulation model was developed, taking into account factors influencing 
      the development of health-seeking behavior. RESULTS: A relationship was found 
      between consumer proinnovative attitude, actual prohealth behavior, and 
      characteristics of the consumer influencing the consumption of calcium. Prohealth 
      behavior (knowledge and application of the principles of healthy eating) is 
      mainly influenced by material situation, age, and gender of the consumer. It has 
      been reported that only 25% of parents talk to their children about the 
      principles of healthy eating. No relationship was found between prohealth and 
      proinnovation behaviors and level of education, sports activity, or number of 
      children in the family. CONCLUSIONS: Among young people, as many as 39% do not 
      follow the principles of healthy eating, and these are mainly women. Respondents' 
      proinnovative attitudes and social status were conducive to increasing calcium 
      intake and correlate with greater diversity in the consumption of dairy products. 
      The Pearson correlation coefficient between body mass index and calcium intake 
      was not significant (r = -0.03; P = 0.76).

AB  - PURPOSE: The term "cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs)" refers to a broad category of 
      diseases that affect the brain's blood vessels and cerebral circulation. 
      Controlling acute hypertension (HTN) by antihypertensive drugs such as 
      clevidipine and nicardipine can be a highly efficient method of lowering the 
      incidence of CVDs. METHODS: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis study. 
      The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science online databases and a gray literature 
      search were performed to identify potentially eligible studies. The included 
      studies were observational studies that compared adult patients receiving 
      clevidipine or nicardipine for controlling HTN in the setting of CVD. RESULTS: We 
      reviewed 5 final included articles, including 546 patients. The pooled 
      standardized mean difference (SMD) for time to goal SBP was - 0.04 (95 % CI: 
      [-0.66; 0.58], p-value: 0.86, I(2): 79.0 %, pooled MD: -12.90 min), meaning that 
      the clevidipine group had a shorter time to goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
      than the nicardipine group. The pooled SMD for total volume infusion was - 0.52 
      (95 % CI: [-0.93; -0.12], p-value: 0.03, I(2): 0.0 %, pooled MD: -1118.81 mL), 
      showing a notably lower total volume infused into patients in the clevidipine 
      group. CONCLUSIONS: We found that clevidipine reaches the SBP goal faster than 
      nicardipine; however, there was no statistically significant difference between 
      the two drugs. The total volume infused to achieve the goal SBP was significantly 
      lower in the clevidipine group. Further prospective studies are needed to compare 
      clevidipine and nicardipine in CVD patients on a large scale.

AB  - While the pursuitworthiness of philosophical ideas has changed over time, 
      philosophical practice and methodology have not kept pace. The worthiness of a 
      philosophical pursuit includes not only the ideas and objectives one pursues but 
      also the methods with which one pursues them. In this paper, we articulate how 
      empirical approaches benefit philosophy of science, particularly advocating for 
      the use of qualitative methods for understanding the social and normative aspects 
      of scientific inquiry. After situating qualitative methods within empirical 
      philosophy of science, we discuss how to adapt these traditionally sociological 
      methods to empirically inform philosophical questions. Our aim is to normalize 
      and legitimize qualitative methods for philosophical purposes and discuss how 
      they can elucidate descriptive and normative components of scientific practice in 
      a more generalizable non-idealized manner. We contend that qualitative methods 
      are particularly well suited to philosophical interest in the social norms of 
      science, their achievability, and their mutability. Furthermore, unlike more 
      historical case studies in philosophy, qualitative methods enable more confidence 
      in generalizability, albeit limited, from a concrete sample to a larger class. We 
      conclude by addressing anxieties about the distinctness of empirical philosophy 
      of science from social epistemology and from sociology of science.

AB  - This article adopts a bottom-up approach to theory interpretation, following the 
      slogan "meaning is use", and applies it to quantum mechanics. I argue that it 
      fits very well with the Consistent Histories formulation of quantum mechanics, 
      interpreted in a particular way that is not the interpretation favoured by 
      original proponents of the formulation. I examine the difficulties and advantages 
      of this interpretation.

AB  - Gene therapy is a powerful treatment modality. Non-viral gene therapy vectors 
      power one arm of this important approach, due to their enhanced safety profile 
      compared to their viral counterparts. New non-viral approaches continue to be 
      developed, but purification can bottleneck the scaleup and cost-effectiveness and 
      quality of some of these advanced vectors. We require more advanced purification 
      and separation techniques compared to conventional methods to maximize resolution 
      in a scalable manner. The Prep Cell system is a continuous electro elution system 
      that contains a circular gel casting tube where DNA mixtures can be run through 
      and subsequently migrate into an elution chamber, to be eluted by a peristaltic 
      pump. This DNA separation and purification process confers advantages over other 
      conventional methods, including i) the elimination of multiple downstream 
      purification process requirements; ii) its ability to be applied in mid-scale 
      settings, and iii), its high-resolution power. In this study, we assessed the 
      ability of this Prep Cell Model 491 system to purify a novel type of non-viral 
      linear covalently closed (LCC) DNA minivector (ministring DNA) from its precursor 
      parent plasmid DNA and process by-product DNA species by analyzing for effective 
      separation via agarose gel electrophoresis, recovery yield, single enzyme 
      digestion, and quality control assessments. Overall, effective separation and 
      resolution of mini-DNA vectors was obtained using the Prep Cell system, 
      conferring its potential to be applied towards mid-scale purification of DNA 
      vectors for a variety of research, and eventually, clinical applications.

AB  - AIM: To investigate predictive factors of student's academic year, interest in 
      the field of nursing, stress, self-efficacy, and problem-focused and 
      emotion-focused coping on the depressive symptoms among undergraduate nursing 
      students. BACKGROUND: As the burden of depression among students has increased 
      worldwide, depressive symptoms have become a standard part of mental health 
      problems in college and university students. Among the various ﬁelds of medical 
      sciences, nursing students face more stressors during their study period and are 
      more at risk of suffering depressive symptoms than other students. DESIGN: A 
      cross-sectional design. METHODS: A total of 230 undergraduate nursing students 
      from a university in Myanmar were recruited from August to September 2021. The 
      data were collected using standard research instruments, including a Demographic 
      Questionnaire, Student Nurse Stress Index Questionnaire, General Self-efficacy 
      Scale, Brief COPE Inventory, and Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale 
      (CES-D). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sociodemographic 
      characteristics of the participants. Inferential statistics were used to identify 
      the predictive effect of academic year, interest in the field of nursing, stress, 
      self-efficacy, problem-focused coping, and emotion-focused coping on depressive 
      symptoms, using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Academic year, 
      interest in the field of nursing, stress, self-efficacy, and problem-focused and 
      emotion-focused coping accounted for 31.5% of the variance of depressive symptoms 
      (F(8, 221) = 12.704, p < .001) with an R(2) = .315. Stress was the factor that 
      most influenced student's depressive symptoms (β = .407, p < .001). Self-efficacy 
      (β = -.244, p < .001) and emotion-focused coping (β = .199, p < .05) were also 
      critical factors contributing to depressive symptoms among undergraduate nursing 
      students. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide insight and knowledge 
      about depressive symptoms and factors that can contribute to depressive symptoms 
      among undergraduate nursing students. Results suggest that nurse educators and 
      community mental health nurses should focus on reducing stress, increasing 
      self-efficacy, and enhancing proper coping strategies among students to prevent 
      depressive symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Home environment provides stimulation and learning opportunities 
      required for children's early development. However, few studies have focused on 
      the effects of home environment on left-behind children's development in rural 
      China. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between home environment 
      and early childhood development of left-behind children under 3 years old in 
      rural China. METHODS: Information about sociodemographic characteristics, 
      caregivers' mental health, home environment and children's development was 
      collected. Infant/Toddler Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment 
      Inventory (IT-HOME) was used to assess home environment. Child's development was 
      evaluated with the Chinese version of the Ages & Stages Questionnaire - third 
      edition. RESULTS: Elevated caregivers' depressive symptoms were associated with a 
      higher risk of total suspected development delay. An increase of one score in the 
      IT-HOME resulted in a 7% decrease in total suspected development delay. Higher 
      scores in the dimensions of involvement and variety were associated with a lower 
      risk of suspected development delay adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results have implications for home-based intervention aiming at promoting 
      nurturing care as well as caregivers' mental health, which is required for early 
      development of young left-behind children in rural areas of China.

AB  - Although miR-27b-3p has been evidenced to regulate the proliferation, apoptosis, 
      and differentiation of a variety of mammalian cell types, its actions and 
      mechanisms on ovarian cell steroidogenesis remains largely unknown in both 
      mammalian and avian species. In this study, we aimed to determine the expression 
      profiles of miR-27b-3p in granulosa cell layers during goose ovarian follicle 
      development and to reveal its actions on estrogen (E(2)) secretion of goose 
      granulosa cells as well as the underlying regulatory mechanisms. It was observed 
      that miR-27b-3p was ubiquitously expressed throughout follicle development but 
      exhibited much higher levels in hierarchical- than in prehierarchical follicles. 
      In cultured granulosa cells from the fourth through second largest preovulatory 
      (F4-F2) follicles of goose, up- and downregulation of miR-27b-3p by using its 
      mimic and inhibitor significantly decreased and increased E(2) secretion, 
      respectively. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of STAR and CYP19A1 were significantly 
      reduced while those of CYP11A1 and 3βHSD were elevated in the mimic-transfected 
      granulosa cells. By comparison, downregulation of miR-27b-3p enhanced the mRNA 
      levels of STAR but had no significant effects on those of CYP19A1, CYP11A1, and 
      3βHSD. Results from bioinformatic prediction and luciferase reporter assay 
      demonstrated that CYP1B1 was a downstream target of miR-27b-3p. Although the 
      siRNA-mediated downregulation of CYP1B1 did not significantly change E(2) 
      secretion by goose granulosa cells, it reduced the mRNA levels of STAR and 
      CYP19A1 as well as those of LKB1 and AMPKα, which are involved in the AMPK 
      signaling pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-27b-3p plays an 
      inhibitory role in E(2) secretion by goose F4-F2 granulosa cells, at least in 
      part, by targeting CYP1B1 through the AMPK signaling pathway.

AB  - The management of body weight (BW) in broiler breeder pullets is critical to 
      offset the negative correlation between their growth potential and reproductive 
      success. Therefore, a precision feeding system was developed to allocate feed 
      individually based on real-time BW in more frequent, smaller portions. However, 
      this system requires access beyond the 8 h daylength of the rearing period. Since 
      green and red spectra have been shown to stimulate growth and sexual maturation, 
      respectively, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of continuous supplemental 
      illumination of feeders with monochromatic wavelengths on sexual maturation. 
      Furthermore, the best combination of supplemental and daytime lighting for 
      optimizing the pullet-to-hen transition period was investigated. This study 
      contained a 2 × 4 × 2 factorial arrangement, with 2 daytime lights (dtRED and 
      dtGREEN; n = 2 rooms), 4 supplemental lights (sBLUE, sGREEN, sRED, and sCON; 
      n = 12 pens), and 2 supplemental intensities (High and Low). At 3 wk of age 
      (woa), 480 female Ross 708 chicks were randomly distributed across treatments 
      (n = 10/pen). All birds were feed restricted per management guidelines and 
      maintained under 8 h of dtRED or dtGREEN. Birds were photostimulated at 20 woa 
      with 14L:10D. All birds were weighed weekly, with age at first egg (AFE) and 
      production rate calculated weekly per pen. Birds under sRED were heavier than all 
      other treatments from 27 woa to the end of the study (P < 0.001; 30 woa), 
      resulting in hens that were over 400-g heavier. This resulted from a delayed AFE 
      and lower production rate under sRED, with higher intensity further hindering 
      reproductive performance (P < 0.001). Interestingly, despite the inhibitory 
      effect of continuous red lighting (sRED) on reproduction, dtRED resulted in a 
      3.15% higher rate of lay than dtGREEN. Therefore, this study suggests that while 
      red light remains superior at stimulating reproduction, continuous red 
      supplemental lighting results in photorefractoriness. Thus, we recommend green 
      light in PF systems.

TI  - Adapting the pantograph limb: Differential robustness of fore- and hindlimb 
      kinematics against genetically induced perturbation in the neural control 
      networks and its evolutionary implications.

AB  - The evolutionary transformation of limb morphology to the four-segmented 
      pantograph of therians is among the milestones of mammalian evolution. But, it is 
      still unknown if changes of the mechanical limb function were accompanied by 
      corresponding changes in development and sensorimotor control. The impressive 
      locomotor performance of mammals leaves no doubt about the high integration of 
      pattern formation, neural control and mechanics. But, deviations from normal 
      intra- and interlimb coordination (spatial and temporal) become evident in the 
      presence of perturbations. We induced a perturbation in the development of the 
      neural circuits of the spinal cord of mice (Mus musculus) using a deletion of the 
      Wilms tumor suppressor gene Wt1 in a subpopulation of dI6 interneurons. These 
      interneurons are assumed to participate in the intermuscular coordination within 
      the limb and in left-right-coordination between the limbs. We describe the 
      locomotor kinematics in mice with conditional Wt1 knockout and compare them to 
      mice without Wt1 deletion. Unlike knockout neonates, knockout adult mice do not 
      display severe deviations from normal (=control group) interlimb coordination, 
      but the coordinated protraction and retraction of the limbs is altered. The 
      forelimbs are more affected by deviations from the control than the hindlimbs. 
      This observation appears to reflect a different degree of integration and 
      resistance against the induced perturbation between the limbs. Interestingly, the 
      observed effects are similar to locomotor deficits reported to arise when sensory 
      feedback from proprioceptors or cutaneous receptors is impaired. A putative 
      participation of Wt1 positive dI6 interneurons in sensorimotor integration is 
      therefore considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Following a European Society for Medical Oncology Women for Oncology 
      (ESMO W4O) survey in 2016 showing severe under-representation of female 
      oncologists in leadership roles, ESMO launched a series of initiatives to address 
      obstacles to gender equity. A follow-up survey in October 2021 investigated 
      progress achieved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The W4O questionnaire 2021 expanded on 
      the 2016 survey, with additional questions on the impact of ethnicity, sexual 
      orientation and religion on career development. Results were analysed according 
      to respondent gender and age. RESULTS: The survey sample was larger than in 2016 
      (n = 1473 versus 482), especially among men. Significantly fewer respondents had 
      managerial or leadership roles than in 2016 (31.8% versus 51.7%). Lack of 
      leadership development for women and unconscious bias were considered more 
      important in 2021 than in 2016. In 2021, more people reported harassment in the 
      workplace than in 2016 (50.3% versus 41.0%). In 2021, ethnicity, sexual 
      orientation and religion were considered to have little or no impact on 
      professional career opportunities, salary setting or related potential pay gap. 
      However, gender had a significant or major impact on career development (25.5% of 
      respondents), especially in respondents ≤40 years of age and women. As in 2016, 
      highest ranked initiatives to foster workplace equity were promotion of work-life 
      balance, development and leadership training and flexible working. Significantly 
      more 2021 respondents (mainly women) supported the need for culture and gender 
      equity education at work than in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Gender remains a major 
      barrier to career progression in oncology and, although some obstacles may have 
      been reduced since 2016, we are a long way from closing the gender gap. Increased 
      reporting of discrimination and inappropriate behaviour in the workplace is a 
      major, priority concern. The W4O 2021 survey findings provide new evidence and 
      highlight the areas for future ESMO interventions to support equity and diversity 
      in oncology career development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are frequently reported during 
      immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy and are associated with long-term 
      outcomes. It is unknown if the irAE occurrence is a valid surrogate of ICIs' 
      efficacy. METHODS: We identified articles reporting the results of randomized 
      trials of experimental ICI therapy in solid tumors with a systematic search. The 
      control arms could be placebo, cytotoxic/targeted therapy, or ICI therapy. We 
      extracted the hazard ratios for overall survival (OS) with the number of OS 
      events per arm and the number and percentages of overall and specific irAEs of 
      grade 1-2 and grade 3-4 per arm. We estimated the treatment effect on the 
      potential surrogate outcome with the odds ratio of the irAE rate between the 
      experimental and the control arm. The statistical analysis consisted of weighted 
      linear regression on a logarithmic scale between treatment effects on irAE rate 
      and treatment effects on OS. RESULTS: Sixty-two randomized trials were included 
      for a total of 79 contrasts and 42 247 patients. The analyses found no 
      significant association between the treatment effects for overall grade 1-2 or 
      grade 3-4 irAE rates or specific (skin, gastrointestinal, endocrine) irAE rates. 
      In the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) trial subset, we observed a negative 
      association between treatment effects on overall grade 1-2 irAEs and treatment 
      effects on OS in studies with patients selected for programmed death-ligand 1 
      expression (R(2) = 0.55; 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.95; R = -0.69). In the 
      melanoma trial subset, a negative association was shown between treatment effects 
      on gastrointestinal grade 3-4 irAEs and treatment effects on OS in trials without 
      an ICI-based control arm (R(2) = 0.77; 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.99; 
      R = -0.89). CONCLUSIONS: We found low-strength correlations between the ICI 
      therapy effects on overall or specific irAE rates and the treatment effects on OS 
      in several cancer types.

AB  - BRAF activation occurs as part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
      cellular signaling pathway which leads to increased cellular proliferation and 
      survival. Mutations in BRAF can result in unbridled activation of downstream 
      kinases with subsequent uncontrolled cellular growth that formulate the basis for 
      oncogenesis in multiple tumor types. Targeting BRAF by selective inhibitors has 
      been one of the early successes in precision oncology. Agents have been explored 
      either as monotherapy or in combination with MEK inhibition in BRAF V600-mutant 
      pan-cancers and with EGFR inhibition in colorectal cancer. Spectrum of BRAF 
      inhibition has evolved from being melanoma-specific to being a pan-cancer target. 
      In this article, we review BRAF and MEK inhibitor drug development journey from 
      tissue-specific melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and anaplastic thyroid 
      cancer to tissue-agnostic approvals.

AB  - In this study we employed a comprehensive immune profiling approach to determine 
      innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA vaccines in 
      patients with myasthenia gravis receiving rituximab. By multicolour cytometry, 
      dendritic and natural killer cells, B- and T-cell subsets, including T-cells 
      producing IFN-γ stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptides, were analysed after 
      infection and mRNA vaccination. In the same conditions, anti-spike antibodies and 
      cytokines' levels were measured in sera. Despite the impaired B cell and humoral 
      response, rituximab patients showed an intact innate, CD8 T-cell and IFN-γ 
      specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response after infection and vaccination, 
      comparable to controls. No signs of cytokine mediated inflammatory cascade was 
      observed. Our study provides evidence of protective immune response after 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA vaccines in patients with myasthenia gravis on B 
      cell depleting therapy and highlights the need for prospective studies with 
      larger cohorts to clarify the role of B cells in SARS-CoV-2 immune response.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease 
      characterized by ectopic lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. To date, no specific 
      drug has been approved for its treatment. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 
      (mGluR5) has been showed expressed in hepatocytes and related to some liver 
      diseases such as alcoholic steatosis. However, the function of mGluR5 in NAFLD is 
      not clear. This work aims to investigate the effect and potential mechanism of 
      mGluR5 in NAFLD. We found that mGluR5 expression was increased in the livers of 
      HFD-fed mice and in palmitate-treated HepG2 cells. Suppression of mGluR5 by the 
      specific antagonist MPEP could ameliorate palmitate-induced lipid accumulation, 
      whereas the mGluR5 agonist CHPG promoted lipid deposition in the cells. Knockdown 
      of mGluR5 by small interfering RNA further demonstrated that inhibition of mGluR5 
      could reduce lipid accumulation. Furthermore, our results revealed that mGluR5 
      regulated lipid metabolism by increasing the gene expression of lipogenesis. 
      Inflammatory factors and phosphorylation levels of NF-κB-p65 and JNK were also 
      tested in treated hepatocytes. mGluR5 promoted the inflammatory reaction and JNK 
      phosphorylation. Inhibition of JNK signaling by JNK-IN-8 rescued CHPG-induced 
      lipogenesis and inflammation. This study showed mGluR5 regulated lipid 
      accumulation and inflammation in palmitic acid-treated HepG2 cells via the JNK 
      signaling pathway. mGluR5 might be a potential drug target for NAFLD.

AB  - Previous research has studied how clinicians such as physicians, nurses, social 
      workers, and nutritionists understand advocacy as a professional responsibility. 
      Analyses have typically focused on individual healthcare professions and have 
      viewed ambiguity around the conceptualization of advocacy as detrimental. Little 
      research has considered how multiple professions within a single field of 
      healthcare interpret clinician advocacy, nor how ambiguity might be productive in 
      a multidisciplinary field. This article addresses these gaps by utilizing science 
      and technology studies scholarship on buzzwords to analyze how clinicians in the 
      field of gender-affirming healthcare have come to understand advocacy as a 
      professional responsibility despite significant ambiguity around the goals, 
      tactics, and targets of advocacy. Gender-affirming healthcare refers to any kind 
      of physical or mental healthcare that transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people 
      obtain to affirm their gender identity. Drawing on interviews with 30 U.S. 
      clinicians, observation of nine transgender health conferences, and content 
      analysis of 202 professional journal articles and 11 professional association 
      statements, I argue that ambiguity around advocacy has been key to its uptake as 
      a responsibility across multiple professions in this field. Foregrounding 
      interview data, I show how polysemy allows clinician respondents across 
      professions to reassert their expertise as they delineate what constitutes good 
      gender-affirming healthcare and defend the emergent field in three problem 
      domains: health insurance, the marginalization of TGD people, and the legality of 
      gender-affirming healthcare. I also demonstrate how theoretical work on buzzwords 
      explains why three clinician respondents rejected advocacy as a professional 
      responsibility.

TI  - Assessing progress towards universal health coverage in Cambodia: Evidence using 
      survey data from 2009 to 2019.

AB  - Over the past decades, many low- and middle-income countries have implemented 
      health financing and system reforms to progress towards universal health coverage 
      (UHC). In the case of Cambodia, out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) remains the main 
      source of current health expenditure after several decades of reform, exposing 
      households to financial risks when accessing healthcare and violating UHC's key 
      tenet of financial protection. We use pre-pandemic data from the nationally 
      representative Cambodia Socio-Economic Surveys of 2009 to 2019 to assess progress 
      in financial protection to evaluate the reforms and obtain internationally 
      comparable estimates. We find that following strong improvements in financial 
      protection between 2009 and 2017, there was a reversal in the trend thereafter. 
      The OOPE budget share rose, and the incidence of catastrophic spending and 
      impoverishment increased in nearly all geographical and socioeconomic strata. For 
      example, 17.7% of households experienced catastrophic health expenditure in 
      2019 at the threshold of 10% of total household consumption expenditure, and 3.9% 
      of households were pushed into poverty by OOPE. The distribution of all financial 
      protection indicators varied strongly across socioeconomic and geographical 
      strata in all years. Fundamentally, the demonstrated trend reversal may 
      jeopardize Cambodia's ability to progress towards UHC. To improve financial 
      protection in the short term, there is a need to address the burden created by 
      OOPE through targeted interventions to household groups that are most affected. 
      In the medium term, our findings emphasize the importance of expanding health 
      pre-payment schemes to currently uncovered vulnerable groups, specifically the 
      near-poor. The government also needs to consider extending the scope of services 
      covered and the range of providers to include the private sector under these 
      schemes to reduce reliance on OOPE.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccination intentions and subsequent uptake: An analysis of the role of 
      marginalisation in society using British longitudinal data.

AB  - COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has previously been modelled using data on intentions 
      - expressed prior to vaccine availability. Once vaccines became widely available, 
      it became possible to model hesitancy using actual vaccination uptake data. This 
      paper estimates the determinants of the joint distribution of COVID-19 
      vaccination intentions (declared before the release of any vaccine) and actual 
      vaccination take-up (when it was widely available across the age distribution). 
      We use high quality longitudinal data (UK Household Longitudinal Study) collected 
      during the pandemic in the UK, merged to a wide variety of individual 
      characteristics collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our estimation draws on 
      pre-Covid values of variables for a sample that includes 10,073 observations from 
      the September 2021 wave. The contribution of this paper is to model hesitancy and 
      uptake jointly. The work shows that people who might be regarded as marginalised 
      in society (measured, before the pandemic began) are less likely to say that they 
      intend to be vaccinated and they go on to also be more likely to actually remain 
      unvaccinated. It also shows that there is a large positive correlation between 
      the unobservable determinants of intention and of uptake. This high positive 
      correlation has an important implication - that information campaigns can be 
      reasonably well profiled to target specific groups on the basis of intention data 
      alone. We also show that changing one's mind is not correlated with observable 
      data. This is consistent with two explanations. Firstly, the new information 
      available on the arrival of vaccines, that they are safe and effective, may be 
      more optimistic than was originally assumed. Secondly, individuals may have been 
      more pessimistic about the effects associated with infection before vaccines 
      became available.

TI  - Assessing the contribution of migration related policies to equity in access to 
      healthcare in European countries. A multilevel analysis.

AB  - Access to good healthcare and the conditions for good health is one of the 
      central dimensions of immigrant integration. National health policies play a 
      major role in equipping residents with the necessary entitlements to accessible 
      and acceptable healthcare services. Rarely analysed so far is the contribution of 
      migration-related health policies to equity in access to healthcare between 
      immigrants and the general population. To address this gap, this study analysed 
      whether the extent to which migration is considered within national health 
      policies moderates the association between immigration status and subjectively 
      perceived unmet medical need in Europe. Using data from the 2019 European Union 
      Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey in combination with 
      the Migration Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) a multilevel analysis was carried 
      out assessing the cross-level interaction between immigration status and MIPEX 
      scores controlling for individual-level factors such as age, gender, education 
      and employment status. While our results showed that immigrants are more likely 
      to report unmet medical need than the general population (adjusted Odds Ratio 
      (aOR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-1.43), the cross-level 
      interaction indicated increased relative inequality in unmet medical need between 
      immigrants and the general population in countries with high MIPEX scores 
      compared to countries with low MIPEX scores (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.18-1.63). The 
      main reason for this increase of inequality on the relative scale was the overall 
      lower prevalence of unmet medical need in countries with high MIPEX scores. In 
      conclusion, our findings indicate that even in countries with relatively 
      migration-friendly health policies inequalities in access to healthcare between 
      immigrants and the general population persist.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine evidence-based nontraditional and home-based interventions 
      and their efficacy for use in individuals with MS to improve performance in their 
      daily activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of five databases including 
      PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, OT Seeker, and Ovid Medline produced 924 
      research articles. Thirty-two articles were selected for full-text review, of 
      which 15 were included in this systematic review. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Articles 
      were level 2B or higher evidence, had a minimum of 19 participants with MS, 
      addressed ADLs or body functions supporting ADL performance, and were published 
      since 2010. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Articles not written in English and not 
      identified as nontraditional or home-based programming. RESULTS: The review 
      uncovered strong evidence for the use of the nontraditional interventions of 
      vestibular rehabilitation, self-management, yoga, musical production, and ELEVIDA 
      to improve ADL performance in individuals with MS. Strong evidence supported the 
      use of home-based programs that included cognitive behavioral therapy, cooling 
      suits, manual dexterity, strengthening, vestibular rehabilitation, and physical 
      activity. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of evidence support the use of nontraditional 
      or home-based interventions to improve ADL performance in clients with MS. 
      Innovation and technology continue to expand the occupational therapist's toolbox 
      of interventions.

      various biological fluids, such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), playing 
      important roles in intercellular communication, both locally and systemically. 
      EVs carry and deliver a variety of bioactive molecules (proteins, nucleic acids, 
      lipids and metabolites), conferring epigenetic and phenotypic changes to the 
      recipient cells and thus resulting as important mediators of both homeostasis and 
      pathogenesis. In neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the EV 
      ability to cross Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), moving from central nervous system 
      (CNS) to the peripheral circulation and vice versa, has increased the interest in 
      EV study in the neurological field. In the present review, we will provide an 
      overview of the recent advances made in understanding the pathogenic role of EVs 
      regarding the immune response, the BBB dysfunction and the CNS inflammatory 
      processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly being used as 
      outcomes in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) trials. We examined 
      how PROs reflect disease burden in SPMS. METHODS: In this observational 
      prospective study, 65 SPMS patients were examined by five different PROs (Fatigue 
      Scale Motor Cognition (FSMC), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale version 2 
      (MSIS-29v2), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2), EQ-5D-5L and 
      Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Multiple Sclerosis 
      version 2.0 (WPAI:MS)); two different rating scales, Multiple Sclerosis 
      Impairment Scale (MSIS) and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS); functional 
      tests of mobility (Timed-25-Foot Walk (T-25FW), 6-Spot Step Test (6-SST) and 
      (9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT)); cognitive tests (Symbol Digital Modalities Test (SDMT) 
      and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R)); and multimodal Magnetic 
      Resonance Imaging (MRI). RESULTS: When the PROs were divided into physical and 
      psychological subscores, the PRO physical subscores of FSMC, MSIS-29v2 and 
      SF-36v2 correlated with physical rating scales (EDSS, MSIS) and physical measures 
      of upper (9-HPT) and lower extremity function (T-25FW and 6-SST)) 
      (p = 0.04-0.0001). 9-HPT correlated the least with physical subscores of PROs but 
      showed the strongest correlation with activity impairment (subscore of WPAI:MS). 
      In contrast, psychological PRO subscores of FSMC, MSIS-29v2 and SF-36v2 did not 
      reflect the cognitive outcomes (SDMT and BVMT-R), although the cognitive scores 
      correlated with disease burden indicated by MRI lesion volumes. The psychological 
      PRO subscores did not correlate with fatigue, physical and MRI outcomes either. 
      CONCLUSION: Correlation between PRO physical subscores and physical outcomes 
      supports PROs as potentially useful clinical endpoints in SPMS. The results of 
      this study indicate that patients with SPMS highly perceive their mobility on 
      function of their lower extremities, while they perceive their daily activities 
      highly dependent on function of the upper extremities. Psychological subscores of 
      MS specific PROs may be less suitable as surrogate markers for the cognitive 
      status and should be considered as a mental quality of life measurement 
      independent of disease burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rituximab is extensively used off-label to treat multiple sclerosis 
      (MS), and long-term vigilance for adverse events is needed. This study was 
      conducted to determine frequencies and predictors of hematological adverse 
      events, including hypogammaglobulinemia, severe lymphopenia, neutropenia, and 
      infections leading to hospitalization. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study 
      included all patients with MS initiating rituximab treatment at Haukeland 
      University Hospital between January 1(st), 2017, and July 1(st), 2021. Patients 
      were followed by clinical monitoring and repeated blood sampling every six 
      months. Clinical outcomes and laboratory results were retrieved from the 
      Norwegian MS Registry and Biobank and the patient administrative system at 
      Haukeland University Hospital. RESULTS: Five hundred and fifty-six patients were 
      included, 515 with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 41 with progressive MS. 
      Overall, 33 patients (5.9%) experienced 56 episodes of infections requiring 
      hospital admission. Sixty patients (10.8%) had confirmed hypogammaglobulinemia, 
      17 (3.1%) had confirmed severe lymphopenia, and 10 (1.8%) had confirmed severe 
      neutropenia. Predictors of infection requiring hospital admission were 
      progressive MS (adjusted OR (aOR): 4.81; 95%CI: 1.25-18.48), duration of 
      treatment with rituximab (aOR: 1.52; 95%CI: 1.11-2.09) and confirmed severe 
      lymphopenia (aOR: 13.58; 95%CI: 3.41-54.06) and neutropenia (aOR: 13.40; 95%CI: 
      2.93-61.25). Of the hematological abnormalities, only hypogammaglobulinemia was 
      associated with treatment duration (aOR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.09-1.69). CONCLUSION: The 
      risk of hospitalization due to infection is associated with time on rituximab 
      treatment, in patients with lympho- or neutropenia, and in patients with primary 
      progressive MS. We observed a time-dependent decline in IgG values, in contrast 
      to neutrophil and lymphocyte count, suggesting a cumulative dose-dependent 
      response. These predictors can assist clinicians in assessing and monitoring MS 
      patients receiving rituximab.

AB  - Alcohol consumption is associated with alterations in memory and learning 
      processes in humans and animals. In this context, research models such as the 
      zebrafish (Danio rerio) arise as key organisms in behavioral and molecular 
      studies that attempt to clarify alterations in the Central Nervous System (CNS), 
      like those related to alcohol use. Accordingly, we used the zebrafish as a model 
      to evaluate the effects of ethanol on the learning and memory process, as well as 
      its relationship with behavior and transcriptional regulation of lrfn2, lrrk2, 
      grin1a, and bdnf genes in the brain. To this end, for the memory and learning 
      evaluation, we conducted the Novel Object Recognition test (NOR); for behavior, 
      the Novel Tank test; and for gene transcription, qPCR, after 2 h, 24 h, and 8 
      days of ethanol exposure. As a result, we noticed in the NOR that after 8 days of 
      ethanol exposure, the control group spent more time exploring the novel object 
      than when compared to 2 h post-exposure, indicating that naturally zebrafish 
      remember familiar objects. In animals in the Treatment group, however, no object 
      recognition behavior was observed, suggesting that alcohol affected the learning 
      and memory processes of the animals and stimulated an anxiolytic effect in them. 
      Regarding transcriptional regulation, 24 h after alcohol exposure, we found 
      hyper-regulation of bdnf and, after 8 days, a hypo-regulation of lrfn2 and lrrk2. 
      To conclude, we demonstrated that ethanol exposure may have influenced learning 
      ability and memory formation in zebrafish, as well as behavior and regulation of 
      gene transcription. These data are relevant for further understanding the 
      application of zebrafish in research associated with ethanol consumption and 
      behavior.

AB  - One primary value of testimony lies in its ability to extend our powers of 
      observation. Do children credit more knowledge to speakers whose testimony goes 
      beyond firsthand observation? The current study investigated 3- to 8-year-old 
      children's (N = 180) and adults' (N = 20) knowledge attributions to speakers who 
      made claims regarding perceptually evident features of a novel animal (e.g., "is 
      brown") or claims regarding perceptually absent features (e.g., "eats insects"). 
      By 7 years of age, children and adults attributed more knowledge to speakers who 
      discussed telescopic information and generalized their knowledge to other 
      domains. Because the knowledge base of child listeners expands with age, they 
      place increased value on telescopic information and the speakers who provide it.

AB  - Developmental precursors of the prelinguistic transition from gestures to word 
      use can be found in the early pragmatic usage of auditory and visual signals 
      across contexts. This study examined whether 6-month-old infants are capable of 
      attention-sensitive communication with their mother, that is, adjusting the 
      sensory modality of their communicative signals to their mother's attention. 
      Proxies of maternal attention implemented in experimental conditions were the 
      mother's visual attention (attentive/inattentive), interaction directed at the 
      infant (interactive/non-interactive), and distance (far/close). The infants' 
      signals were coded as either visual or auditory, following an ethological coding. 
      Infants adjusted the sensory modality of their communicative signals mostly to 
      maternal interaction. More auditory signals were produced when the mother was 
      non-interactive than when she was interactive. Interactive conditions were 
      characterized by higher rates of visual signaling and of gaze-coordinated 
      non-vocal oral sounds. The more time infants spent looking at their attentive 
      mother, the more they produced auditory signals, specifically non-vocal oral 
      sounds. These findings are discussed within the articulated frameworks of 
      evolutionary developmental psychology and early pragmatics.

AB  - In spoken languages, face masks represent an obstacle to speech understanding and 
      influence metacognitive judgments, reducing confidence and increasing effort 
      while listening. To date, all studies on face masks and communication involved 
      spoken languages and hearing participants, leaving us with no insight on how 
      masked communication impacts on non-spoken languages. Here, we examined the 
      effects of face masks on sign language comprehension and metacognition. In an 
      online experiment, deaf participants (N = 60) watched three parts of a story 
      signed without mask, with a transparent mask or with an opaque mask, and answered 
      questions about story content, as well as their perceived effort, feeling of 
      understanding, and confidence in their answers. Results showed that feeling of 
      understanding and perceived effort worsened as the visual condition changed from 
      no mask to transparent or opaque masks, while comprehension of the story was not 
      significantly different across visual conditions. We propose that metacognitive 
      effects could be due to the reduction of pragmatic, linguistic and 
      para-linguistic cues from the lower face, hidden by the mask. This reduction 
      could impact on lower-face linguistic components perception, attitude 
      attribution, classification of emotions and prosody of a conversation, driving 
      the observed effects on metacognitive judgments but leaving sign language 
      comprehension substantially unchanged, even if with a higher effort. These 
      results represent a novel step towards better understanding what drives 
      metacognitive effects of face masks while communicating face to face and 
      highlight the importance of including the metacognitive dimension in human 
      communication research.

      derivatives were synthesized, and evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial 
      activity. The obtained results revealed marked antimicrobial potential against

      6,7-dimethyl-3-(2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-oxoethyl)quinoxalin-2(1H)-one (4d), and 
      2-(2-(9H-fluoren-9-ylidene)hydrazineyl)-5-(2-(p-tolyl)hydrazineylidene)thiazol-4(5H)-one 
      (11b) displayed significant antibacterial and antifungal activities having MIC 
      ranges (1.98-15.6 mg/mL) and (1.98-3.9 mg/mL) compared to Tetracycline and 
      Amphotericin B as standard drugs. In addition, they showed noticeable inhibitory 
      activity against DNA gyrase enzyme. Interestingly the thiazole derivative (11b) 
      showed marked inhibitory activity against DNA gyrase with IC(50) = 7.82 ± 0.45 μM 
      better than that of ciprofloxacin. The time-kill kinetics profile of the most 
      active compounds against S. aureus and E. coli microorganisms displayed both 
      concentration dependent and time dependent reduction in the number of viable 
      cells. Furthermore, molecular docking study of both compounds in the DNA gyrase 
      binding site was performed, showing agreement with the in vitro inhibitory 
      activities.

AB  - Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a heterobifunctional molecule with 
      enormous potential for its ability to overcome the limitations of traditional 
      inhibitors. However, its inherent disadvantages have been increasingly revealed, 
      such as poor cell permeability caused by large molecule weight. Herein, to 
      overcome the inherent shortcomings, intracellular self-assembly was proposed 
      based on bioorthogonal reaction and molecular fragments, affording a novel type 
      of self-assembled PROTACs. Two types of precursors incorporated with tetrazine 
      and norbornene as bioorthogonal groups were designed and synthesized, and they 
      could subsequently be conjugated in cells to generate novel PROTACs. Fortunately, 
      ultrafast HRMS and HPLC assays indicated that self-assembled PROTACs driven by 
      the bio-orthogonal reaction were detected in living U87 cells. Biological 
      evaluation suggested that the precursor molecule LN-1 could degrade PDGFR-β 
      protein in a concentration-dependent manner, while cancer cells were co-treated 
      with another precursor molecule, TzB. Our findings verified the feasibility of a 
      self-assembly strategy in future development of novel PROTACs.

AB  - Novel series of benzoxazole-appended piperidine derivatives were planned, 
      synthesized and screened against two breast cancer cell lines. Considerable 
      antiproliferative activity was observed for screened compounds 
      (IC(50) = 33.32 ± 0.2 µM to 7.31 ± 0.43 µM and 1.66 ± 0.08 µM to 12.10 ± 0.57 µM) 
      against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines respectively being more potent than 
      doxorubicin (IC(50) = 8.20 ± 0.39 µM and 13.34 ± 0.63 µM respectively). Active 
      compounds were submitted for enzyme inhibition assays when 4d and 7h demonstrated 
      potent EGFR inhibition (0.08 ± 0.002 µM and 0.09 ± 0.002 µM respectively) 
      compared to erlotinib (0.11 ± 0.003 µM). However, no one compound displayed 
      effective ARO inhibition activity as tested compounds were less active than 
      letrozole. Apoptosis inducing ability results implied that apoptosis was provoked 
      by significant stimulation of caspase-9 protein levels (4.25-7.04-fold) upon 
      treatment of MCF-7 cells with 4a, 7h, 9, 12e and 12f. Alternatively, MDA-MB-231 
      cells treated with 4d, 7a, 12b and 12c considerably increased caspase-9 levels 
      (2.32-4.06-fold). Cell cycle arrest and annexin-V/Propidium iodide assays further 
      confirmed apoptosis when tested compounds arrested cell cycle at various phases 
      and demonstrated high annexin V binding affinity. Docking outcomes proved 
      valuable binding affinities for compounds 4d and 7h to EGFR enzyme while 
      compounds 4a and 12e, upon docking into the active site of ARO, failed to 
      interact with heme, suggesting their inabilities to act as AIs. Therefore, these 
      benzoxazoles can act as promising candidates exhibiting EGFR inhibition and 
      apoptosis-promoting properties.

AB  - Matrine is a clinically used adjuvant anticancer drug, yet its mild potency 
      limited its application. To improve the anticancer activity of matrine, a total 
      of 31 indole-matrine hybrids were constructed in four rounds of SAR-guided 
      iterative structural optimization process. All of the synthesized compounds were 
      evaluated for their antiproliferative activities against a panel of four human 
      cancer cell lines (Hela, MCF-7, SGC-7901, HepG2) and two normal cell lines 
      (GES-1, LO2). The most active hybrid 8g exhibited the anticancer IC(50) values of 
      0.9 to 1.2 μM, which was 3-magnitude of orders more potent than matrine. 8g also 
      showed better selectivity towards cancer cells with the selectivity index value 
      raised from 1.5 to 6.2. Mechanistic studies demonstrated a mitochondrial 
      distribution for 8g by intracellular click chemistry approaches, which led to the 
      discovery that 8g strongly induced mitochondrial stress, as evidenced by impaired 
      energy metabolism, depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, overload of 
      mitochondrial calcium and escalated ROS production. 8g-induced mitochondrial 
      stress further led to the release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of 
      caspase 3, which significantly promoted cellular death and inhibited colony 
      formation.

AB  - Mitochondrial function has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. 
      Mitochondrial dynamics is a foundational activity underlying the maintenance of 
      mitochondrial function in bioenergetics, the maintenance of MtDNA, calcium 
      homeostasis, reactive oxygen species metabolism, and quality control. Loss of 
      mitochondrial plasticity in terms of functions, morphology and dynamics may also 
      be the critical switch from NAFLD/NASH to HCC. However, the cause of 
      mitochondrial fission in NAFLD remains unclear. Recent studies have reported that 
      EGFR can bind to Mfn1 and interfere with its polymerization. In this study, we 
      investigated whether EGFR binds to Mfn1 in NAFLD, and whether reducing their 
      binding can improve NAFLD in zebrafish model. Our results demonstrated that EGFR 
      was activated in hepatocytes from high fructose (HF)-induced NAFLD zebrafish and 
      interfered with Mfn1 polymerization, leading to reduction of MtDNA. Suppression 
      of EGFR activation or mitochondrial translocation significantly improved 
      mitochondrial morphology and increased mitochondrial DNA, ultimately preventing 
      hepatic steatosis. In conclusion, these results suggest that EGFR binding to Mfn1 
      plays an important role in NAFLD zebrafish model and that inhibition of their 
      binding could be a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - Eif2ak4, a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes, encodes GCN2, a molecule 
      activated by amino acid deficiency. Mutations or deletions in GCN2 in pancreatic 
      β-cells increase mTORC1 activity by decreasing Sestrin2 expression in a 
      TSC2-independent manner. In this study, we searched for molecules downstream of 
      GCN2 that suppress mTORC1 activity in a TSC2-dependent manner. To do so, we used 
      a pull-down assay to identify molecules that competitively inhibit the binding of 
      the T1462 phosphorylation site of TSC2 to 14-3-3. l-asparaginase was identified. 
      Although l-asparaginase is frequently used as an anticancer drug for acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia, little is known about endogenous l-asparaginase. 
      l-Asparaginase, which is expressed downstream of GCN2, was found to bind 14-3-3 
      and thereby to inhibit its binding to the T1462 phosphorylation site of TSC2 and 
      contribute to TSC2 activation and mTORC1 inactivation upon TSC2 
      dephosphorylation. Further investigation of the regulation of mTORC1 activity in 
      pancreatic β-cells by l-asparaginase should help to elucidate the mechanism of 
      diabetes and insulin secretion failure during anticancer drug use.

AB  - With the rapid population growth, the world is witnessing an ever-increasing 
      demand for energy and natural resources. Consequently, soil, air, and water are 
      polluted with diverse pollutants, including heavy metals (HM). The detection of 
      heavy metals is necessary to remediate them, which is achieved with biosensors. 
      Initially, these HM were detected using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), 
      emission spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, gas chromatography etc., but these were 
      costly and time consuming which further paved a way for microbe-based biosensors. 
      The development of genetic circuits for microbe-based biosensors has become more 
      popular in recent years for heavy metal detection. In this review, we have 
      especially discussed the various types of genetic circuits such as toggle 
      switches, logic gates, and amplification modules used in these biosensors as they 
      are used to enhance sensitivity and specificity. Genetic circuits also allow for 
      rapid and multiple analyte detection at the same time. The use of microbial 
      biosensors for the detection of HM in the soil as well as the water is also 
      described below. Although with a higher success rate than classical biosensors, 
      these microbial biosensors still have some drawbacks like bioavailability and 
      size of the analyte which are needed to be addressed.

AB  - Gene expression patterns in complex multicellular organisms are regulated by 
      enhancers, which communicate with their target gene promoters in 
      three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structures. Despite advances in our 
      understanding of the mechanisms that organize mammalian genomes into compartments 
      and topologically associating domains (TADs), it is not well understood how 
      specific interactions between enhancers and promoters are controlled in this 3D 
      context. In this review, we give an overview of recent evidence that shows that a 
      process of loop extrusion plays an important role in the regulation of 
      enhancer-promoter communication and discuss recent insights into the molecular 
      mechanism by which loop extrusion contributes to enhancer-mediated gene 
      activation.

AB  - This paper introduces two indoor cases in China, characterized by bodies lying on 
      a mattress, covered with thick quilts and wearing clothes. There were obvious 
      deviation in the estimated minimum postmortem interval (PMI(min)) of the corpses 
      using entomological methods. Based on the forensic entomology evidence from the 
      scene, the PMI(min) estimated using temperature data from the nearest weather 
      station was longer than the actual postmortem interval (PMI) based on the police 
      investigation and the security camera footage. The most probable cause of the 
      errors in PMI(min) estimation was the hindrance in heat dissipation since the 
      corpses were covered with thick quilts while lying on the mattress. Therefore, 
      the heat generated by the decomposition process and larval activity was hard to 
      lose, resulting in the rapid development of insects. These case reports emphasize 
      the importance of temperature collection in forensic entomological 
      investigations. Our findings call for standardized temperature acquisition 
      procedures, including which temperature measurements (body, microenvironment or

      pandemic.

AB  - Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are a group of synthetic chemicals used in numerous 
      consumer products such as plastics and furniture. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) pandemic significantly slowed anthropogenic activities and reduced the 
      emissions of pollutants. Meanwhile, the mismanagement of large quantities of 
      disposable plastic facemasks intensified the problems of plastic pollution and 
      leachable pollutants in coastal waters. In this study, the joint effects of the 
      COVID-19 outbreak on the occurrence of 12 targeted OPEs in the waters of Laizhou 
      Bay (LZB) were investigated. The results showed that the median total OPE 
      concentrations were 725, 363, and 109 ng L(-1) in the sewage treatment plant 
      effluent, river water, and bay water in 2021, decreased significantly (p < 0.05) 
      by 67%, 68%, and 70%, respectively, compared with those before the COVID-19 
      outbreak. The release potential of targeted OPEs from disposable surgical masks 
      in the LZB area was ∼0.24 kg yr(-1), which was insufficient to increase the OPE 
      concentration in the LZB waters. The concentrations of most individual OPEs 
      significantly decreased in LZB waters from 2019 to 2021, except for TBOEP and 
      TNBP. Spatially, a lower concentration of OPEs was found in the Yellow River 
      estuary area in 2021 compared with that before the COVID-19 pandemic due to the 
      high content of suspended particulate matter in the YR. A higher total OPE 
      concentration was observed along the northeastern coast of LZB, mainly owing to 
      the construction of an artificial island since 2020. The ecological risks of the 
      OPE mixture in LZB waters were lower than those before the COVID-19 outbreak. 
      However, TCEP, TNBP, and BDP should receive continuous attention because of their 
      potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms.

AB  - Considering the increasing demand for desalination plants and their byproduct 
      brine, this study investigated a humidification-dehumidification (HDH) system for 
      treating membrane distillation-generated real high-salinity brine using low-grade 
      heat (45-70 ℃) to explore its feasibility for sustainable energy-efficient 
      minimal liquid discharge. A novel super-hydrophilic fabric was adopted for 
      accelerated humidification, and its impact on brine droplet miscarriage 
      characteristics was evaluated. The influence of the operating fluid thermal 
      properties (cycle 1: air preheating; cycle 2: air and brine dual-fluid 
      preheating; and cycle 3: air post-heating after humidification) on the brine 
      treatment efficiency, energy consumption, and chemical quality of freshwater 
      produced was analyzed in detail to establish their characteristic nexus. It was 
      identified that, during humidification, increasing the brine temperature (up to 
      55 ℃) influenced its ionic mobility, thereby promoting efficient separation of 
      the salts/minerals and contributing to achieving better freshwater quality. 
      Furthermore, although cycle 3 exhibited improved system thermal efficiency 
      (gained output ratio equal to 1.77), its non-preheated air contributed to a 
      negative effect of the reduced humidity ratio (∼17 g/kg), leading to a lower 
      freshwater productivity of 67% than that of cycle 2 (29 g/kg and 70%). The 
      present study also illustrates a novel effect of evaporative deposition occurring 
      due to air-water interaction on the fabric humidifier surface, with an 
      exploration of its effect on reducing freshwater chemical quality. The freshwater 
      generated from optimum thermal cycle 2 exhibited reduced pH (by ∼63%), sodium 
      (99.9%), chloride (99.9%), toxic boron (99.7%), and other chemical contaminants, 
      thereby satisfying the major international water reuse standards.

AB  - Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) bacteria imposing double-edged 
      sword effects on anammox bacteria were investigated in an anammox-membrane 
      bioreactor (MBR) experiencing an induced crash-recovery event. During the 
      experiment, the anammox-MBR was loaded with NH(4)(+)-N:NO(2)(-)-N ratios 
      (RatioNH(4)(+)-N: NO(2)(-)-N) of 1.20-1.60. Initially, the anammox-MBR removed 
      over 95% of 100 mg/L NH(4)(+)-N and 132 mg/L NO(2)(-)-N (RatioNH(4)(+)-N: 
      NO(2)(-)-N = 0.76, the well accepted stoichiometric RatioNH(4)(+)-N: NO(2)(-)-N 
      for anammox) in the influent (Stage 0). Then, we induced a system crash-recovery 
      event via nitrite shock loadings to better understand responses from different 
      guilds of bacteria in anammox-MBR, loaded with 1.60 RatioNH(4)(+)-N: NO(2)(-)-N 
      with 100 mg/L NO(2)(-)-N in the influent (Stage 1). Interestingly, the nitrogen 
      removal by anammox bacteria was maintained for about 20 days before starting to 
      decrease significantly. In Stage 2, we further increased influent nitrite 
      concentration to 120 mg/L (1.33 RatioNH(4)(+)-N: NO(2)(-)-N) to simulate a high 
      nitrite toxicity scenario for a short period of time. As expected, nitrogen 
      removal efficiency dropped to only 16.8%. After the induced system crash, 
      anammox-MBR performance recovered steadily to 93.2% nitrogen removal with a 1.25 
      RatioNH(4)(+)-N:NO(2)(-)-N and a low nitrite influent concentration of 80 mg/L 
      NO(2)(-)-N. Metagenomics analysis revealed that a probable causality of the 
      decreasing nitrogen removal efficiency in Stage 1 was the overgrowth of 
      DNRA-capable bacteria. The results showed that the members within the 
      Ignavibacteriales order (21.7%) out competed anammox bacteria (17.0%) in the 
      anammox-MBR with elevated nitrite concentrations in the effluent. High NO(2)(-)-N 
      loading (120 mg N/L) further caused the predominant Candidatus Kuenenia spp. were 
      replaced by Candidatus Brocadia spp. Therefore, it was evident that DNRA bacteria 
      posed negative effects on anammox with 1.60 RatioNH(4)(+)-N: NO(2)(-)-N. Also, 
      when 120 mg/L NO(2)(-)-N fed to anammox-MBR (RatioNH(4)(+)-N: NO(2)(-)-N = 1.33), 
      canonical denitrification became the primary nitrogen sink with both DNRA and 
      anammox activities decreased. They probably fed on lysed microbial cells of 
      anammox and DNRA. In Stage 3, a low RatioNH(4)(+)-N: NO(2)(-)-N (1.25) with 
      80 mg/L NO(2)(-)-N was used to rescue the system, which effectively promoted 
      DNRA-capable bacteria growth. Although anammox bacteria's abundance was only 7.7% 
      during this stage, they could be responsible for about 90% of the total nitrogen 
      removal during this stage.

AB  - The Eastern Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP-ER) is a 
      large scale multi-decade infrastructure project aiming to divert substantial 
      amounts of water (≈45 billion m(3) yr(-1)) to alleviate water shortage in 
      comparatively arid regions of northern China. The project has ramifications for 
      hydrological connectivity and biogeochemical cycling of dissolved organic matter 
      (DOM) in regional lakes affected by the project. We carried out an extensive 
      field sampling campaign along the SNWDP-ER in different hydrological seasons of 
      2018 and monthly observations in Lake Hongze and Lake Luoma from April 2018 to 
      June 2021. We found the lakes connecting to the SNWDP-ER had higher mean DOC, 
      specific UV absorbance, higher ratio of humic-like to protein-like fluorophores 
      (Humic : Protein), and shallower spectral slope (S(275-295)) in the wet season 
      compared to the wet-to-dry transition, and dry seasons. The southern lakes and 
      Yangtze River had lower DOC concentration, bioavailable DOC (BDOC), and higher 
      DOM aromaticity compared to the northern two downstream lakes. 
      Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) revealed higher relative 
      abundance of CHO-containing and aromatic compounds in the Yangtze River and the 
      southern three upstream lakes compared to the northern two lakes. The data from 
      Lake Hongze and Lake Luoma, studied in different hydrological seasons, suggest 
      that water delivery had high consistency in DOM composition and BDOC over the 
      season. We conclude that positioning along the watercourse and seasonally 
      variable hydrological conditions play an important role in influencing the DOM 
      composition and bioavailability of key lakes connecting to the SNWDP-ER. Our 
      results indicated that the water diversion project delivers water with low DOC 
      concentration and higher aromaticity and thus is of higher quality since it has 
      higher DOM removal potential during drinking water treatment.

AB  - In the era of the current epidemic, it is urgent to control pathogens in sewage, 
      eliminate the source of infection, and optimize the technology for killing 
      pathogens. Combining calcium peroxide (CaO(2)) with sunlight is considered a 
      potentially efficient, economical, and eco-friendly method for 
      pathogen-contaminated water remediation. This paper evaluated the solar 
      activating properties of CaO(2) for inactivating pathogenic indicators and 
      explored the roles of reactive species contributing to pathogen inactivation. 
      Moreover, these reactive species' average steady-state concentrations and 
      second-order reaction rate were tentatively explored, and mechanistic model for 
      photoinactivation were establishment. Pathogen's inactivation was mainly 
      attributed to direct photoinactivation (13∼50%) and exogenous indirect mechanisms 
      with corresponding contributions of reactive species, i.e., OH(-) (14∼23%), 
      (1)O(2) (12∼28%), •OH (20∼32%), O(2)(•-) (12∼16%), and H(2)O(2) (6∼11%). 
      Furthermore, cell membrane rupture and DNA damage were observed by transmission 
      electron microscopy (TEM) and agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) experiments. 
      Among experiments on common aqueous constituents influencing photoinactivation, 
      copper and iron ions were found to promote a pathogen-inactivating ability of the 
      system, while fulvic acids (FA) and humic acid (HA) had the opposite effect. This 
      study revealed the potential of CaO(2)/sunlight to inactivate pathogens and laid 
      a foundation for its application in inactivating pathogens in surface water.

AB  - A single exposure to some stressors results in long-lasting consequences 
      reminiscent of those found in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but results 
      are very often controversial. Although there is no consensus regarding the best 
      animal models of PTSD, the single prolonged stress (SPS) model, consisting of 
      sequential exposure within the same day to various stressors (typically 
      restraint, forced swim, and ether), has gained acceptance. However, results, 
      particularly those related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, are 
      inconsistent and there is no evidence that SPS is clearly distinct from models 
      using a single severe stressor. In the present study, we compared in male rats 
      the behavioral and neuroendocrine (HPA) consequences of exposure to 
      immobilization on boards (IMO) with a SPS-like model (SPSi) in which IMO and 
      isoflurane were substituted for restraint and ether, respectively. Both 
      procedures caused a similar impact on food intake and body weight as well as on 
      sensitization of the HPA response to a novel environment (hole-board) on the 
      following day. Reduction of activity/exploration in the hole-board was also 
      similar with both stressors, although the impact of sudden noise was higher in 
      SPSi than IMO. Neither IMO nor SPSi significantly affected contextual fear 
      conditioning acquisition, although a similar trend for impaired fear extinction 
      was observed compared to controls. Exposure to additional stressors in the SPSi 
      did not interfere with homotypic adaptation of the HPA axis to IMO. Thus, only 
      modest neuroendocrine and behavioral differences were observed between IMO and 
      SPSi and more studies comparing putative PTSD models are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dried blood spots (DBS) have been utilized as a blood plasma 
      alternative for therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacologic analysis. There are 
      analytical and physiochemical considerations in bridging drug concentrations from 
      plasma to DBS. Recently, the long-acting antiretroviral cabotegravir (CAB) has 
      been approved for HIV prevention, and a co-packaged regimen of long-acting CAB 
      and rilpivirine (RPV) has been approved for HIV treatment. Measurement of these 
      drugs in blood collected as DBS may offer increased capacity and flexibility in 
      translational applications. METHODS: Whole blood was spiked with CAB and RPV and 
      spotted on DBS cards. Following extraction and addition of isotopically labeled 
      internal standards, samples were subjected to liquid chromatographic-tandem mass 
      spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The method was validated according to 
      regulatory recommendations, and the assay was evaluated in remnant samples from 
      an HIV prevention trial in which paired DBS and plasma samples were collected. 
      RESULTS: DBS CAB and RPV concentrations were linear from 25 to 20,000 ng/mL and 
      2-2500 ng/mL, respectively. Precision, accuracy, and matrix effect results were 
      acceptable. DBS RPV demonstrated stability under all tested conditions; DBS CAB 
      showed mean biases of - 23.5% when stored at room temperature for 36 days, and 
      - 18.0% at 40 °C and 100% humidity for two days. DBS measurements for CAB and RPV 
      were an average 54.0% and 14.1% lower, respectively, as compared to paired plasma 
      samples. Derived conversion factors of 1.79 and 1.16 were applied to DBS CAB and 
      RPV measurements, respectively, to estimate plasma concentrations. Estimated 
      plasma CAB and RPV concentrations showed mean biases of 2.2% and 0.6%, 
      respectively. In a CAB clinical trial, application of the conversion factor 
      resulted in agreement between estimated plasma CAB concentrations from DBS and 
      plasma CAB concentrations (y = 1.08x - 79.2, r = 0.932; mean bias of -3.2%; 95% 
      CI: -48.2% to 41.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a novel LC-MS/MS 
      assay for the quantification of CAB and RPV from DBS, and identified conversion 
      factors to estimate plasma concentrations from spotted blood.

AB  - Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata is one of the most famous traditional Chinese 
      medicines possessing a variety of pharmacological activities on top of the 
      toxicities. Due to the heterogeneity and non-standardization of the processing 
      procedures, the subtypes and contents of the differential compounds between 
      different processed products still remained indistinct, causing great risk in 
      their proper use. In order to achieve the comparison and quality evaluation of 
      different processed products of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata and develop 
      new processed products with less toxicity, a quantification and pseudotargeted 
      metabolomics method was developed based on the dynamic MRM mode of triple 
      quadrupole (QqQ) mass spectrometry, and multivariate statistical analysis methods 
      were applied to compare different processed products. Method validation results 
      indicated good specificity, linearity, repeatability, precision, stability and 
      recovery of the established quantification method and good linearity, precision 
      and stability of the pseudotargeted metabolomics method. Differential compounds 
      of different processed products were screened out and further confirmed by the 
      quantification results. At last, the processing procedures were optimized to 
      obtain new processed products of "Heishunpian" (black slices) with less toxicity, 
      in which the contents of the toxic diester-type diterpenoid alkaloids were 
      reduced from 106.98 μg/g to 0.85-12.96 μg/g. This study provided a valuable 
      reference for the establishment of comprehensive quality evaluation methods of 
      herbal medicines and a scientific basis for the optimization of processing 
      procedures of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata.

AB  - Abscisic acid (ABA) is an endogenous phytohormone that plays an important role in 
      regulating plant growth, development, and stress response. Pyrabactin resistance 
      1-like (PYR/PYL) proteins are ABA receptors and core components of ABA signalling 
      in plants. This study identified nine PYL genes in the Brachypodium distachyon 
      genome and they distribute on three chromosomes. Phylogenetical BdPYLs were 
      classified into three clades. 81 protein-protein interactions between 9 BdPYLs 
      and 9 BdPP2C proteins were predicted and 66 pairs were verified by yeast 
      two-hybrid assay previously. Relatively, BdPYL genes are expressed in leaves at 
      high level, and ABA and drought regulate their expression. A homologue of 
      Arabidopsis PYL9, BdPYL5 was selected to overexpress in Arabidopsis to 
      characterize its function. In general, overexpression of BdPYL5 enhanced ABA 
      sensitivity and drought tolerance, implying its conserved function. Our study 
      lays the foundation for further functional elucidation of BdPYL genes.

AB  - The oil and gas industries are the largest producers of NORM wastes that are 
      continuously generated during production and extraction activities. In addition, 
      an increasing trend is observed in waste production worldwide due to the 
      decommissioning of oil platforms. The problem is that most of these wastes are in 
      activity concentration levels above the exemption and the clearance limits and 
      are being accumulated in storage sites because no repositories exist in Brazil 
      for NORM wastes generated by oil industries. There are regulations for 
      radioactive wastes and for the licensing of repositories for managing wastes with 
      low and intermediate levels of radiation but the current regulations apply only 
      to packaged wastes. Therefore an initial radiological assessment was carried out 
      with the RESRAD-OFFSITE code to show that bulk NORM wastes (not packaged wastes) 
      could be disposed of in repositories near the surface without causing additional 
      risk to the public above the criteria used. The results can also support 
      decision-making by the Regulatory Authority to change the current regulations and 
      allow for the disposal of wastes in bulk form.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to translate the Medication Use Questionnaire into a 
      Malay version, adapt it to Malaysia's culture, and verify its reliability among 
      Malaysia's older adults. METHODS: Methodological approaches were used to 
      translate, validate, and modify the questionnaire. The subjects were older adults 
      aged ≥ 60 years in primary care settings in Penang, Malaysia. Two forward 
      translations (English to Malay) were developed, reviewed, and back translated to 
      English. The reconciliation phase was conducted to compare the translated and 
      original questionnaires. Five older adults were then interviewed for the 
      cognitive debriefing of the reconciled questionnaire to assess the linguistic and 
      cultural equivalence. Two experts assessed content validity, and the translated 
      questionnaire was proofread and finalized. After that, pilot test was done to 
      examine the internal consistency among 20 older adults. RESULTS: Translation of 
      the questionnaire was done with no major disagreements. The main issues 
      identified in cognitive debriefing and content validity were terms, number of 
      questions, and phrases used in the questionnaire. Most participants reported that 
      the questionnaires were not difficult to complete during the cognitive debriefing 
      phase. The issues were then judged and revised accordingly. Further pilot testing 
      on 20 older adults demonstrated good internal consistency reliability, Cronbach α 
      (0.902). CONCLUSIONS: This study findings suggest promising data supporting the 
      use of translated version of the Medication Use Questionnaire that can be used to 
      identify medication use problems among older adults in Malaysia.

AB  - Patients with classic low-flow low-gradient (cLFLG) aortic stenosis (AS) have a 
      poor prognosis but still benefit from aortic valve replacement. There is a 
      paucity of evidence to guide the choice between transcatheter aortic valve 
      replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This study 
      compared procedural and midterm outcomes in patients with cLFLG AS between TAVR 
      and SAVR. Patients with cLFLG AS, defined as an aortic valve area ≤1 cm(2), mean 
      gradient <40 mm Hg, and left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, were selected 
      from a single center between 2015 and 2020. Inverse probability weighting and 
      regression were used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics, the 
      nonrandom assignment of treatment modalities, and procedural differences. The 
      primary end point was all-cause mortality. A total of 322 patients (220 TAVR and 
      102 SAVR) were included. At a follow-up of 4.4 ± 1.5 years, the adjusted hazard 
      ratio (HR) for mortality after inverse probability weighting with SAVR was 0.66, 
      95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 1.35; p = 0.24. Worse renal function at 
      baseline (per 10 ml/min/m(2) increase HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.00, p = 0.04) and 
      multiple valve interventions (HR 5.39, 95% CI 2.62 to 11.12, p <0.001) 
      independently predicted mortality. There was no difference in stroke and 
      permanent pacemaker implantation, but the rates of renal replacement therapy were 
      higher among the SAVR cohort: 13.7% versus 0%; p <0.001. In conclusion, among 
      patients with cLFLG AS, there was no difference in midterm mortality between TAVR 
      and SAVR, supporting the use of either treatment. However, in patients with poor 
      renal function or at risk of renal failure, TAVR may be the preferred option.

AB  - Scaffolds delivered to injured spinal cords to stimulate axon connectivity often 
      match the anisotropy of native tissue using guidance cues along the 
      rostral-caudal axis, but current approaches do not mimic the heterogeneity of 
      host tissue mechanics. Although white and gray matter have different mechanical 
      properties, it remains unclear whether tissue mechanics also vary along the 
      length of the cord. Mechanical testing performed in this study indicates that 
      bulk spinal cord mechanics do differ along anatomical level and that these 
      differences are caused by variations in the ratio of white and gray matter. These 
      results suggest that scaffolds recreating the heterogeneity of spinal cord tissue 
      mechanics must account for the disparity between gray and white matter. Digital 
      light processing (DLP) provides a means to mimic spinal cord topology, but has 
      previously been limited to printing homogeneous mechanical properties. We 
      describe a means to modify DLP to print scaffolds that mimic spinal cord 
      mechanical heterogeneity caused by variation in the ratio of white and gray 
      matter, which improves axon infiltration compared to controls exhibiting 
      homogeneous mechanical properties. These results demonstrate that scaffolds 
      matching the mechanical heterogeneity of white and gray matter improve the 
      effectiveness of biomaterials transplanted within the injured spinal cord.

AB  - Cancer treatment modalities have gradually shifted from monotherapies to 
      multimodal therapies. It is still a challenge to develop a synergistic 
      chemo-phototherapy system with relieving tumor hypoxia, specific targeting, and 
      real-time fluorescence tracking. In this study, we designed a multifunctional 
      BODIPY derivative, FBD-M, for synergistic chemo-phototherapy against hypoxic 
      tumors. FBD-M was composed of four parts: 1) The BODIPY fluorophore selected as a 
      theranostic core, 2) A pentafluorobenzene group modified on meso-BODIPY to carry 
      oxygen, 3) A morpholine group hooked to one side of BODIPY served as a 
      lysosome-targeting unit for enhancing antitumor effect, and 4) An aromatic 
      nitrogen mustard group introduced on other side of BODIPY to achieve 
      chemotherapy. After introducing the morpholine and aromatic nitrogen mustard in 
      BODIPY, the conjugate system of BODIPY was also expanded to realize near-infrared 
      (NIR) phototherapy. Finally, FBD-M was obtained by a rational design, which 
      possessed with NIR absorbance and emission, photosensitive activity, 
      oxygen-carrying capability for relieving tumor hypoxia, high photothermal 
      conversion efficiency, good photostability, lysosome targeting, low toxicity, and 
      synergistic chemo-phototherapy against hypoxic tumors. FBD-M had been 
      successfully applied for anticancer in vitro and in vivo. Our study demonstrates 
      that FBD-M can serve as an ideal multifunctional theranostic agents.

AB  - Epilepsy is the most common symptom in patients with brain tumors. The shared 
      genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms between tumorigenesis and 
      epileptogenesis represent 'two sides of the same coin'. These include augmented 
      neuronal excitatory transmission, impaired inhibitory transmission, genetic 
      mutations in the BRAF, IDH, and PIK3CA genes, inflammation, hemodynamic 
      impairments, and astrocyte dysfunction, which are still largely unknown. 
      Low-grade developmental brain tumors are those most commonly associated with 
      epilepsy. Given this strict relationship, drugs able to target both seizures and 
      tumors would be of extreme clinical usefulness. In this regard, anti-seizure 
      medications (ASMs) are optimal candidates as they have well-characterized effects 
      and safety profiles, do not increase the risk of developing cancer, and already 
      offer well-defined seizure control. The most important ASMs showing preclinical 
      and clinical efficacy are brivaracetam, lacosamide, perampanel, and especially 
      valproic acid and levetiracetam. However, the data quality is low or limited to 
      preclinical studies, and results are sometimes conflicting. Future trials with a 
      prospective, randomized, and controlled design accounting for different 
      prognostic factors will help clarify the role of these ASMs and the clinical 
      setting in which they might be used. In conclusion, brain tumor-related 
      epilepsies are clear examples of how close, multidisciplinary collaborations 
      among investigators with different expertise are warranted for pursuing 
      scientific knowledge and, more importantly, for the well-being of patients 
      needing targeted and effective therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are multiple reviews on cardiovascular aspects of COVID-19 
      disease on cardiovascular system in different population but there is lack of 
      evidence about cardiovascular adverse effects of COVID vaccines. OBJECTIVES: The 
      purpose of this study was to compare the cardiac complications of COVID19 
      vaccines, based on vaccine type (mRNA, vector-based, and inactivated vaccines). 
      METHODS: A systematic search was performed covering PubMed for English 
      case-reports and case-series studies, and finally 100 studies were included. 
      RESULTS: Myocarditis (with overall rate around 1.62%) was shown to be the most 
      common post-COVID19 immunization cardiac event. More than 90% of post-COVID19 
      vaccination myocarditis occurred after receiving mRNA vaccines (Moderna & 
      Pfizer-BioNTech), but the report of this event was less in the case of 
      vector-based vaccinations and/or inactivated vaccines. Myocarditis was reported 
      more commonly in men and following the second dose of the immunization. Takotsubo 
      cardiomyopathy (TTC) was reported after mRNA (more commonly) and vector-based 
      vaccinations, with no case report after inactivated vaccines. When mRNA and 
      vector-based vaccinations were used instead of inactivated vaccines, a greater 
      frequency of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and pulmonary 
      emboli (PE) was reported. Myocardial infarction/cardiac arrest was recorded in 
      those beyond the age of 75 years. CONCLUSION: The personal and public health 
      benefits of COVID-19 vaccination much outweigh the minor cardiac risks. Reporting 
      bias, regarding more available mRNA vaccines in developed countries, may conflict 
      these results.

AB  - Enthralling evidence of the potential of graphene-based materials for neural 
      tissue engineering is motivating the development of scaffolds using various 
      structures related to graphene such as graphene oxide (GO) or its reduced form. 
      Here, we investigated a strategy based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) combined 
      with a decellularized extracellular matrix from adipose tissue (adECM), which is 
      still unexplored for neural repair and regeneration. Scaffolds containing up to 
      50 wt% rGO relative to adECM were prepared by thermally induced phase separation 
      assisted by carbodiimide (EDC) crosslinking. Using partially reduced GO enables 
      fine-tuning of the structural interaction between rGO and adECM. As the 
      concentration of rGO increased, non-covalent bonding gradually prevailed over 
      EDC-induced covalent conjugation with the adECM. Edge-to-edge aggregation of rGO 
      favours adECM to act as a biomolecular physical crosslinker to rGO, leading to 
      the softening of the scaffolds. The unique biochemistry of adECM allows neural 
      stem cells to adhere and grow. Importantly, high rGO concentrations directly 
      control cell fate by inducing the differentiation of both NE-4C cells and 
      embryonic neural progenitor cells into neurons. Furthermore, primary astrocyte 
      fate is also modulated as increasing rGO boosts the expression of reactivity 
      markers while unaltering the expression of scar-forming ones.

AB  - Dynamic wetting is a ubiquitous phenomenon and frequently observed in our daily 
      life, as exemplified by the famous lotus effect. It is also an interfacial 
      process of upmost importance involving many cutting-edge applications and has 
      hence received significantly increasing academic and industrial attention for 
      several decades. However, we are still far away to completely understand and 
      predict wetting dynamics for a given system due to the complexity of this dynamic 
      process. The physics of moving contact lines is mainly ascribed to the full 
      coupling with the solid surface on which the liquids contact, the atmosphere 
      surrounding the liquids, and the physico-chemical characteristics of the liquids 
      involved (small-molecule liquids, metal liquids, polymer liquids, and simulated 
      liquids). Therefore, to deepen the understanding and efficiently harness wetting 
      dynamics, we propose to review the major advances in the available literature. 
      After an introduction providing a concise and general background on dynamic 
      wetting, the main theories are presented and critically compared. Next, the 
      dynamic wetting of various liquids ranging from small-molecule liquids to 
      simulated liquids are systematically summarized, in which the new physical 
      concepts (such as surface segregation, contact line fluctuations, etc.) are 
      particularly highlighted. Subsequently, the related emerging applications are 
      briefly presented in this review. Finally, some tentative suggestions and 
      challenges are proposed with the aim to guide future developments.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer is a major health concern. It is now 
      the third most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality 
      worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of machine 
      learning algorithms for predicting survival of colorectal cancer patients 1 to 5 
      years after diagnosis, and identify the most important variables. METHODS: A 
      sample of 1236 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 118 predictor 
      variables has been used. The outcome of interest was a binary variable indicating 
      whether the patient survived the number of years in question or not. 20 predictor 
      variables were selected using mutual information score with the outcome. We 
      implemented 11 machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance with a 
      5 by 2-fold cross-validation with stratified folds and with paired Student's 
      t-tests. We compared the results with the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox's 
      proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Using the 20 most important predictor 
      variables for each of the survival years, the logistic regression algorithm 
      achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.850 
      (0.014 SD, 0.840-0.860 95 % CI) for the 1-year, and 0.872 (0.014 SD, 0.861-0.882 
      95% CI) for the 5-year survival prediction. Using only the 5 most important 
      predictor variables, the corresponding values are 0.793 (0.020 SD, 0.778-0.807 
      95% CI) and 0.794 (0.011 SD, 0.785-0.802 95% CI). The most important variables 
      for 1-year prediction were number of R residual, M distant metastasis, overall 
      stage, probable recurrence within 5 years, and tumour length, whereas for 5-year 
      prediction the most important were probable recurrence within 5 years, R 
      residual, M distant metastasis, number of positive lymph nodes, and palliative 
      chemotherapy. Biomarkers do not appear among the top 20 most important ones. For 
      all survival intervals, the probability of the top model agrees with the 
      Kaplan-Meier estimate, both in the interval of one standard deviation and in the 
      95% confidence interval. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that machine learning 
      algorithms can predict the survival probability of colorectal cancer patients and 
      can be used to inform the patients and assist decision-making in clinical care 
      management. In addition, this study unveils the most essential variables for 
      estimating survival short- and long-term among patients with Colorectal cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a pervasive and debilitating 
      disease, wherein degeneration of cartilage features prominently. Despite 
      extensive research, we do not yet understand the cause or progression of OA. 
      Studies show biochemical, mechanical, and biological factors affect cartilage 
      health. Mechanical loads influence synthesis of biochemical constituents which 
      build and/or break down cartilage, and which in turn affect mechanical loads. 
      OA-associated biochemical profiles activate cellular activity that disrupts 
      homeostasis. To understand the complex interplay among mechanical stimuli, 
      biochemical signaling, and cartilage function requires integrating vast research 
      on experimental mechanics and mechanobiology-a task approachable only with 
      computational models. At present, mechanical models of cartilage generally lack 
      chemo-biological effects, and biochemical models lack coupled mechanics, let 
      alone interactions over time. METHODS: We establish a first-of-its kind virtual 
      cartilage: a modeling framework that considers time-dependent, 
      chemo-mechano-biologically induced turnover of key constituents resulting from 
      biochemical, mechanical, and/or biological activity. We include the "minimally 
      essential" yet complex chemical and mechanobiological mechanisms. Our 3-D 
      framework integrates a constitutive model for the mechanics of cartilage with a 
      novel model of homeostatic adaptation by chondrocytes to pathological mechanical 
      stimuli, and a new application of anisotropic growth (loss) to simulate 
      degradation clinically observed as cartilage thinning. RESULTS: Using a single 
      set of representative parameters, our simulations of immobilizing and overloading 
      successfully captured loss of cartilage quantified experimentally. Simulations of 
      immobilizing, overloading, and injuring cartilage predicted dose-dependent 
      recovery of cartilage when treated with suramin, a proposed therapeutic for OA. 
      The modeling framework prompted us to add growth factors to the suramin 
      treatment, which predicted even better recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Our flexible 
      framework is a first step toward computational investigations of how cartilage 
      and chondrocytes mechanically and biochemically evolve in degeneration of OA and 
      respond to pharmacological therapies. Our framework will enable future studies to 
      link physical activity and resulting mechanical stimuli to progression of OA and 
      loss of cartilage function, facilitating new fundamental understanding of the 
      complex progression of OA and elucidating new perspectives on causes, treatments, 
      and possible preventions.

      multi-directionality in coronary atherosclerosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In this paper we investigate twelve 
      multi-directional/topological wall shear stress (WSS) derived metrics and their 
      relationships with the formation of coronary plaques in both computational fluid 
      dynamics (CFD) and dynamic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) frameworks. While 
      low WSS is one of the most established biomechanical markers associated with 
      coronary atherosclerosis progression, alone it is limited. Multi-directional and 
      topological WSS derived metrics have been shown to be important in 
      atherosclerosis related mechanotransduction and near-wall transport processes. 
      However, the relationships between these twelve WSS metrics and the influence of 
      both FSI simulations and coronary dynamics is understudied. METHODS: We first 
      investigate the relationships between these twelve WSS derived metrics, stenosis 
      percentage and lesion length through a parametric, transient CFD study. Secondly, 
      we extend the parametric study to FSI, both with and without the addition of 
      coronary dynamics, and assess their correlations. Finally, we present the case of 
      a patient who underwent invasive coronary angiography and optical coherence 
      tomography imaging at two time points 18 months apart. Associations between each 
      of the twelve WSS derived metrics in CFD, static FSI and dynamic FSI simulations 
      were assessed against areas of positive/negative vessel remodelling, and changes 
      in plaque morphology. RESULTS: 22-32% stenosis was the threshold beyond which 
      adverse multi-directional/topological WSS results. Each metric produced a 
      different relationship with changing stenoses and lesion length. Transient 
      haemodynamics was impacted by coronary dynamics, with the topological shear 
      variation index suppressed by up to 94%. These changes appear more critical at 
      smaller stenosis levels, suggesting coronary dynamics could play a role in the 
      earlier stages of atherosclerosis development. In the patient case, both dynamics 
      and FSI vs CFD changes altered associations with measured changes in plaque 
      morphology. An appendix of the linear fits between the various FSI- and CFD-based 
      simulations is provided to assist in scaling CFD-based results to resemble the 
      compliant walled characteristics of FSI more accurately. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results highlight the potential for coronary dynamics to alter 
      multi-directional/topological WSS metrics which could impact associations with 
      changes in coronary atherosclerosis over time. These results warrant further 
      investigation in a wider range of morphological settings and longitudinal cohort 
      studies in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We recently reported improvements of working memory 
      across 10 years post stroke among middle-aged individuals. However, the 
      mechanisms underlying working-memory recovery are largely unknown. This study 
      investigated the associations between long-term improvement of working memory and 
      resting-state functional connectivity in two frontoparietal networks: the 
      frontoparietal network and the dorsal attention network. METHODS: Working memory 
      was repeatedly assessed by the Digit Span Backwards task in 21 persons, within 
      1 year after stroke onset and again 10 years post stroke onset. Brain functional 
      connectivity was examined by resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      at the 10-year follow-up. RESULTS: A significant improvement of working memory 
      was found among 21 persons after stroke (median age = 64) at the 10-year 
      follow-up compared to the within-one-year assessment. The magnitude of 
      performance improvement on the Digit Span Backwards task was significantly 
      positively correlated with stronger brain connectivity in the frontoparietal 
      network (r = 0.51, p = 0.018) measured at the 10-year follow-up only. A similar 
      association was observed in the dorsal attention network (r = 0.43, p = 0.052) 
      but not in a visual network (r = -0.17, p = 0.46) that served as a control 
      network. The association between functional connectivity within the 
      above-mentioned networks and Digit Span Backwards scores at 10-year after stroke 
      was in the same direction but did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present work relate stronger long-term performance improvement on the Digit Span 
      Backwards task with higher integrity of frontoparietal network connectivity.

AB  - We investigate whether exposure to rainfall shocks affects the experience of 
      physical intimate partner violence (P-IPV) among women in rural areas of the 
      Peruvian Andes. Using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys over 
      2005-2014, we track changes in the probability that a woman experiences recent 
      instances of P-IPV after being exposed to a rainfall shock during the last 
      cropping season. Our results indicate that the probability that a woman 
      experiences P-IPV increases by 8.5 percentage points (65 percent) after exposure 
      to a dry, but not a wet, shock during the cropping season. We identify two 
      complementary causal pathways of this effect: increased economic insecurity and 
      poverty-related stress that deteriorates men's emotional well-being and mental 
      health, and reduced female empowerment that affects women's ability to negotiate 
      their preferences within the relationship.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neurological manifestations compatible with small vessel brain 
      lesions (SVBL), such as migraine, cognitive impairment, seizures, and transverse 
      myelitis, may be related to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and patients could 
      need APS therapies even though they do not fit into thrombosis or obstetric 
      morbidity. Furthermore, extra-criteria antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) provide 
      an increase in sensitivity in patients with clinical manifestations related to 
      APS but negative for IgG/IgM anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-β2 glycoprotein I 
      (aβ2GPI), and lupus anticoagulant, which are the antibodies included in the 
      classification criteria for APS. METHODS: We determined extra-criteria aPL in 65 
      SVBL patients with neurological traits and Magnetic Resonance Imaging suggestive 
      of APS but negative for APS classification criteria, 47 of whom were 
      prospectively followed and tested over three years. A group of 95 patients with 
      autoimmune diseases (AD) but without clinical traits of APS was also studied. 
      RESULTS: A persistent presence of extra-criteria aPL was detected in 27.7% of 
      patients: 12.77% IgM anti- prothrombin (PT), 6.38% IgG anti-PT, 6.38% IgM 
      anti-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 4.26% IgA aβ2GPI, 2.13% IgG 
      anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (PS/PT) and 2.13% IgM anti-PS/PT. There was a 
      tendency towards a higher prevalence of these aPL in SVBL patients than in AD - 
      especially for IgA aβ2GPI - and a lack of IgG aPS/PT positivity in the AD group. 
      We found no SVBL patient positive for IgA aCL, IgG anti-PE, annexin V, or aβ2GPI 
      domain I. CONCLUSIONS: Extra-criteria aPL can improve sensitivity for APS 
      diagnosis in patients with SVBL, especially IgA aβ2GPI and IgG anti-PS/PT 
      antibodies.

TI  - Household income is associated with functional outcomes in a multi-institutional

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened awareness of health disparities 
      associated with socioeconomic status (SES) across the United States. We examined 
      whether household income is associated with functional outcomes after stroke and 
      COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multi-institutional, retrospective 
      cohort study of consecutively hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 and 
      radiographically confirmed stroke presenting from March through November 2020 to 
      any of five comprehensive stroke centers in metropolitan Chicago, Illinois, USA. 
      Zip-code-derived household income was dichotomized at the Chicago median. 
      Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between household income 
      and good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-3 at discharge, after 
      ischemic stroke). RESULTS: Across five hospitals, 159 patients were included. 
      Black patients comprised 48.1%, White patients 38.6%, and Hispanic patients 
      27.7%. Median household income was $46,938 [IQR: $32,460-63,219]. Ischemic stroke 
      occurred in 115 (72.3%) patients (median NIHSS 7, IQR: 0.5-18.5) and hemorrhagic 
      stroke in 37 (23.7%). When controlling for age, sex, severe COVID-19, and NIHSS, 
      patients with ischemic stroke and household income above the Chicago median were 
      more likely to have a good functional outcome at discharge (OR 7.53, 95% CI 1.61 
      - 45.73; P=0.016). Race/ethnicity were not included in final adjusted models 
      given collinearity with income. CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-institutional study of 
      hospitalized patients with stroke, those residing in higher SES zip codes were 
      more likely to have better functional outcomes, despite controlling for stroke 
      severity and COVID-19 severity. This suggests that area-based SES factors may 
      play a role in outcomes from stroke and COVID-19.

AB  - The association between cadmium and breast cancer remains unexplained due to 
      inconsistent epidemiological data and unknown underlying mechanisms. This study 
      aimed to assess the relationship between environmental exposure to cadmium and 
      the Warburg effect in breast cancer and, thus, its possible interference with 
      breast cancer treatment. The observational study in two groups of breast cancer 
      patients indicated a positive correlation between urinary cadmium concentration 
      and tumor expression of HIF1A (a master regulator of the Warburg effect). Further 
      explanatory research in MCF-7 cells showed no impact of cadmium exposure on 
      molecular and biochemical markers of the Warburg effect. However, long-term 
      exposure to a low and environmentally relevant concentration of cadmium led to 
      the accumulation of the metal in MCF-7 cells and decreased their sensitivity to 
      tamoxifen. To conclude, the association between cadmium and the Warburg effect 
      was suggested in the observational study, although not confirmed in vitro. 
      Nevertheless, cadmium seems to interfere with tamoxifen treatment which deserves 
      further investigation in terms of its possible implication in intrinsic 
      resistance to hormone therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Even though many oral glucose-lowering or lipid-lowering agents have 
      already been reported to improve hepatic steatosis to some degree, which drug had 
      a more beneficial effect on hepatic steatosis among those drugs has not been 
      precisely explored. We analysed the effect of empagliflozi, a selective 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and ezetimibe on developing hepatic 
      steatosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using 4005,779 patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) or dyslipidemia provided by the Korean National Health Insurance 
      Service (NHIS) between January 2015 and December 2015, we analyzed the odds ratio 
      (OR) of fatty liver development (fatty liver index [FLI] >60). Additionally, we 
      examined the metabolic effects of ezetimibe and empagliflozin in mice fed with a 
      choline-deficient high-fat diet, mimicking the features of human NAFLD. The 
      experiment for agents was performed for the non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and 
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mouse models independently. In the NHIS 
      data, ORs for the development of fatty liver were significantly lower in all 
      treatment groups than in the reference group, which did not receive ezetimibe or 
      empagliflozin. (Ezetimibe therapy; OR=0.962, empagliflozin therapy; OR=0.527, 
      ezetimibe plus empagliflozin; OR=0.509 compared to reference therapy). Unlike 
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis mouse model, ezetimibe, empagliflozin, and 
      combination therapy also reduced liver steatosis in the non-alcoholic fatty liver 
      mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other agents, empagliflozin and/or 
      ezetimibe treatment reduced the risk of developing hepatic steatosis. Our data 
      suggest that empagliflozin or ezetimibe can be primarily considered in type 2 DM 
      or dyslipidemia patients to prevent hepatic steatosis.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the steel industry is one of the top 
      priorities for mitigating climate change. Although hydrogen has been considered 
      as a key element to accomplish this task, the effects of various hydrogen-using 
      technologies in steel mills have not been analysed and compared to each other. 
      This paper quantitatively analysed the greenhouse gas reduction in steel mills by 
      the use of hydrogen produced from electrolysis with renewable electricity. The 
      four following methods of using green hydrogen were proposed and analysed: 1) use 
      of hydrogen directly in the hydrogen steelmaking process, 2) use of hydrogen to 
      convert byproduct gases produced from steel mills into methanol, 3) use hydrogen 
      to convert the byproduct gases into methane, and 4) sell hydrogen to the hydrogen 
      station and use of oxygen, another product of electrolysis, to reduce the use of 
      air separating unit in steel mills. Not only the greenhouse gas reduction 
      benefits but also the economic cost of these four methods were evaluated. As 
      those results can vary according to country, the economic cost and GHG reduction 
      benefits were determined for the representative steel-producing countries of 
      China, India, Japan, the United States, Russia, South Korea, and Germany. The 
      economic cost was evaluated not only for the present (2020) but also for the 
      future (∼2040) because these methods are more likely to be implemented in the 
      future. Currently, in the representative steel-producing countries, Method 1 was 
      analysed to have the largest GHG reduction among the four methods; but it also 
      showed the largest cost because of its large capital expenditures and electricity 
      cost. Method 2, which converts the byproduct gases into methanol, was shown to 
      offer larger GHG reduction and smaller economic cost than Method 3, which 
      converts the byproduct gases into methane. Comparing Methods 1 and 2, Method 2 
      offered smaller GHG reduction but a much smaller economic cost than Method 1. 
      Although the cost of Method 4 is currently the smallest, the economic cost of 
      Method 2 is predicted to become lower than that of Method 4 in the future, near 
      2030, because the future prices of hydrogen and the CO(2) allowance are expected 
      to decrease and increase, respectively. These results can be utilized when 
      steelmaking country or steelmaking company make their decision on how to decrease 
      the GHG emissions by using green hydrogen.

AB  - The application of microalgae to sequester CO(2) from flue gases can be an 
      interesting process since it can contribute to mitigate CO(2) emission into the 
      atmosphere. One obstacle of such application is the high CO(2) concentration in 
      the flue gases, which can lead to low pH in the cultivation medium and hence 
      process failure. This study aims to investigate static CO(2) gas supply for 
      microalgae cultivation as a potential alternative that might allow applying 
      different flue gases with different compositions and higher CO(2) concentrations. 
      Two sets of experiments were performed. First, the effect of increasing the 
      amount of supplied carbon was tested. In the second experiment, the applicability 
      of such system for different flue gases regarding their oxygen and carbon content 
      was tested. In all experiments, 50 times diluted cow manure digestate was used as 
      a culture medium. By increasing CO(2) concentration up to 10% in the supplied 
      air, microalgae growth productivity of 48.7 mg/L/d was achieved. A further 
      improvement of microalgae growth was shown with increasing the gas/culture volume 
      ratio. Microalgae productivity rate increased form 48.7 mg/L/d to 73.5 mg/L/d 
      when the volume of gas increased from 47% to 81% of total volume. Applying CO(2) 
      in air (O(2) content around 20%) or in N(2) (O(2) content less than 2%) didn't 
      show any difference regarding inorganic carbon dissolution, pH, ammonium nitrogen 
      removal, CO(2) fixation or biomass productivity. Generally, it can be concluded 
      that static gas supply for microalgae cultivation can allow the application of 
      different flue gases from different industries with low or high O(2) content and 
      with CO(2) concentration as high as 20%. According to our results, a microalgae 
      cultivation system with continuous static gas supply was proposed.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in coastal areas severely affected the health of 
      ecosystem and human beings. The HABs control by biological methods, especially 
      for biofilms, has been research hotspots in freshwater ecosystem. However, the 
      biofilm-relating control of HABs in marine environment was very limited. In the 
      present study, we found the population growth of two harmful algal species, 
      Prorocentrum obtusidens Schiller (formerly P. donghaiense Lu) and Heterosigma 
      akashiwo, were inhibited by a diatom-bacteria biofilm. The highest inhibitory 
      rate was 79.6 ± 2.1% for P. obtusidens when co-cultured with biofilm suspension, 
      and was 88.6 ± 5.8% for H. akashiwo when co-cultured with the biofilm filtrate 
      without nutrient replenishment. When nitrate and phosphate were added, the 
      inhibition rate for P. obtusidens was 72.3 ± 2.0%, but the population inhibition 
      was not found in H. akashiwo. It suggested that P. obtusidens was mainly 
      inhibited via interference competition, while the inhibition of H. akashiwo was 
      resulted from exploitation competition. We further investigated the role of fatty 
      acids for the interference competition in P. obtusidens, and found that fatty 
      acids at their environmental-relevance concentrations can inhibit the 
      photosynthetic capacity of P. obtusidens, but cannot inhibit the population 
      growth. The community of biofilm shifted, and was finally dominated by the 
      photoheterotrophic bacterium Dinoroseobacter shibae, and the diatom Fistulifera 
      sp. with relative abundance of higher than 90%. Our study indicated that the 
      diatom-bacteria biofilm was likely the candidate for the HABs control in marine 
      environment. D. shibae and Fistulifera sp. were probably the effective species in 
      the biofilm.

      contractors based on the behavioral decisions of the main participants. The study 
      aims to improve positive influences among contractors with respect to the 
      sustainable development of construction. Using the SIR 
      (susceptible-infected-removed) model, we reconsider contractors of different 
      states; construct state transformation paths for potential adopters, adopters, 
      and abandoners of green behaviors among contractors; and analyze the factors that 
      influence the diffusion of green behaviors among contractors to simulate the 
      effects of different paths of behavior diffusion. The results show that two 
      paths, adoption and recovery rates, have a positive influence on the diffusion of 
      green behavior, while three other paths have a negative influence. The identified 
      factors exhibit two types of influence, promotion and hindrance, involving both 
      intra-firm and government regulations, and are associated with other 
      stakeholders. This study promotes the diffusion of green behavior among 
      contractors, which allows contractors to gain a competitive advantage in advance 
      and has positive implications for the implementation of environmentally friendly 
      concepts in the construction industry.

AB  - The length of global coastline is about 356 thousand kilometers with various 
      dynamic natural and anthropogenic. Although the number of studies on coastal 
      landscape categorization has been increasing, it is still difficult to 
      distinguish precisely them because the used methods commonly are traditional 
      qualitative ones. With the leverage of remote sensing data and GIS tools, it 
      helps categorize and identify a variety of features on land and water based on 
      multi-source data. The aim of study is using different natural - social profile 
      data obtained from ALOS, NOAA, and multi-temporal Landsat satellite images as 
      input data of the convolutional-neural-network (CvNet) models for coastal 
      landscape classification. Studies used 900 cut-line samples which represent 
      coastal landscapes in Vietnam for training and optimizing CvNet models. As a 
      result, nine coastal landscapes were identified including: deltas, alluvial, 
      mature and young sand dunes, cliff, lagoon, tectonic, karst, and transitional 
      landscapes. Three CvNet models using three different optimizer types classified 
      the landscapes of other 1150 cut-lines in Vietnam with the accuracies about 98% 
      and low loss function value. Excepting dalmatian, karst and delta coastal 
      landscapes, five others distribute heterogeneous along the coasts in Vietnam. 
      Therefore, the evaluation of additional natural components is necessary and CvNet 
      model have ability to update new landscape types in variety of tropical nation as 
      a step toward coastal landscape classification at both national and global 
      scales.

AB  - Based on an extended STIRPAT framework, this paper investigates the effects of 
      financial development on carbon emission intensity in OECD countries from linear 
      and non-linear perspectives, where financial development is proxied by three 
      dimensions: financial deepening, financial deepening, and financial size, and 
      financial efficiency. Fortunately, three types of financial development 
      significantly alleviate carbon emission intensity. An extended moderation effect 
      model is built to estimate the effect of financial development via information 
      and communication technology on carbon emission intensity. The results reveal 
      that internet-based information and communication technology and service-based 
      information and communication technology are positively correlated with carbon 
      emission intensity. To effectively handle the endogeneity issue triggered by 
      causal relationships between variables and allow potential non-linear nexus, an 
      advanced dynamic panel threshold model incorporating the generalised method of 
      moments is employed to investigate how financial development affects carbon 
      emission intensity under different types of information and communication 
      technology. Empirical evidence demonstrates the significance of the non-linear 
      nexus between financial development and carbon emission intensity. Lastly, 
      heterogeneity analysis demonstrates the existence of heterogeneity associated 
      with institutional quality, degree of economic development, and resource 
      endowment concerning the effect of financial development on carbon emission 
      intensity among the OECD countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During COVID pandemic response, an early signal was desired beyond 
      typical financial classifications or order sets. The foundational work of 
      Virginia K Saba informed the essential, symbiotic relationship of nursing 
      practice and resource utilization by means of the Clinical Care Classification 
      System [CCC]. Scholars have confirmed the use of the CCC as the structure for 
      data modeling, focusing on the concept of nursing cost [1]. Therefore, the 
      purpose of this retrospective, descriptive study was to determine if analysis of 
      CCC Care Component codes could provide a high granularity signal of early shifts 
      in patient demographics and in nursing care interventions and to, then, determine 
      if nursing care intervention shifts indicated changes in resource utilization. 
      METHODS: For a large multi-facility healthcare system in the USA, patients cared 
      for in an acute care setting/hospital-based care unit were the population of 
      interest. Through prior and ongoing efforts of ensuring Evidenced-Based Clinical 
      Documentation [EBCD], a data model was utilized to determine changes in the 
      patient's nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions, during care episodes, for 
      patients with acute symptoms or diagnosed/confirmed COVID. RESULTS: The structure 
      of CCC revealed 22 billion individual instances of the CCC Care Component/Concept 
      codes for the data sets for 2017 and during COVID, a considerably large data set 
      suitable for pre- and post- event analyses. The component codes were included in 
      a string data set for concept/diagnosis/intervention. DISCUSSION: By our 
      analysis, these CCC Information Model elements determined a clear ability to 
      detect increasing demands of nursing and resources, prior to other data models, 
      including supply chain data, provider documented diagnostic codes, or laboratory 
      test codes. Therefore, we conclude CCC System structure and Nursing Intervention 
      codes allow for earlier detection of pandemic care nursing resource demands, 
      despite the perceived challenges of "timeliness of documentation" attributed to 
      more constrained timelines of data models of nursing care.

AB  - Current knowledge of Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology and effective therapy 
      remains limited. Thus, the identification of biomarkers is crucial to improve the 
      detection and treatment of patients with AD. Using robust rank aggregation method 
      to analyze the microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus database, we 
      identified 1138 differentially expressed genes in AD. We then explored 13 hub 
      genes by weighted gene co-expression network analysis, least absolute shrinkage, 
      and selection operator, and logistic regression in the training dataset. The 
      detection model, which composed of CD163, CDC42SE1, CECR6, CSF1R, CYP27A1, 
      EIF4E3, H2AFJ, IFIT2, IL10RA, KIAA1324, PSTPIP1, SLA, and TBC1D2 genes, along 
      with APOE gene, showed that the area under the curve for detecting AD was 0.821 
      (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.782-0.861) and the model was validated in ADNI 
      dataset (area under the curve = 0.776; 95%CI = 0.686-0.865). Notably, the 13 
      genes in the model were highly enriched in immune function. These findings have 
      implications for the detection and therapeutic target of AD.

AB  - Anaerobic oxidation of methane-microbial fuel cells with acetate-acclimatizing or 
      formate-acclimatizing electroactive culture (A-AOM-MFC and F-AOM-MFC) were 
      designed and operated at room temperature in this study to evaluate and explore 
      the electrochemical performance and mechanisms of methane conversion and 
      electricity generation. The results indicated that A-AOM-MFC output a higher 
      voltage (0.526 ± 0.001 V) and F-AOM-MFC started up in a shorter time (51 d), 
      resulting from different mechanisms of methane-electrogen caused by discrepant 
      microbial alliances. Specifically, in A-AOM-MFC, acetoclastic methanogens (e.g., 
      Methanosaeta) converted methane into intermediates (e.g., acetate) through 
      reversing methanogenesis and carried out the direct interspecific electron 
      transfer (DIET) with Geobacter-predominated electricigens which can oxidize the 
      intermediates to carbon dioxide and transfer electrons to the electrodes. 
      Differently, the intermediate-dependent extracellular electron transfer (EET) 
      existed in F-AOM-MFC between hydro-methanogens (e.g., Methanobacterium) and 
      electricigens (e.g., Geothrix), which was more difficult than DIET. Additionally, 
      hydro-methanogens metabolized methane to produce formate-dominant intermediates 
      more quickly.

AB  - Talonavicular arthrodesis is associated with a rate of non-union that ranges from 
      3 % to 37 %. Various fixation devices have been reported for talonavicular 
      arthrodesis including screws, staples, plates, K-wires and intraosseous fix 
      systems, however there is no definitive gold standard. This systematic review 
      aims to compare clinical outcomes between different fixation devices for 
      talonavicular arthrodesis. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and Google Scholar 
      were reviewed for studies reporting on outcomes of different fixation techniques 
      for talonavicular arthrodesis indicated for osteoarthritis, inflammatory and 
      post-traumatic arthritis from 1946 to 2021. The primary outcome measure was union 
      rate. Secondary outcome measures included functional improvement, cost, quality 
      of life and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: 9 articles involving 141 cases of 
      talonavicular arthrodesis were identified. Fusion rates were as follows: screw 
      fixation (n = 75): 87.5 % to 100 %, staple fixation (n = 13): 100 %, intraosseous 
      fix system (n = 16): 100 %, and K-wire fixation (n = 2): 100 %. One study 
      utilised a dorsal locking plate with two supplemented compression screws (n = 9, 
      fusion rate= 100 %) and two studies used a combination of screws with staples 
      (n = 26, fusion rate= 96 %). 7 of 9 studies measured functional outcomes and pain 
      relief with improvement demonstrated in all fixation techniques. Quality of life, 
      satisfaction and cost were inadequately reported amongst the included studies. 
      All studies were rated as serious risk of bias. CONCLUSION: This systematic 
      review consolidates the evidence for outcomes of different fixation techniques 
      for TN arthrodesis, however a definitive judgement regarding the best fixation 
      technique is unobtainable from current clinical evidence, due to lack of 
      high-quality studies. With review of biomechanical studies and the limited 
      clinical data, fixation with plate plus screw is most promising and would warrant 
      further comparative study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

AB  - This narrative review provides a historical overview of cytoreductive nephrectomy 
      for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and examines the safety and 
      therapeutic potential of cytoreductive stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) 
      for mRCC in the modern immunotherapy era. In the last five years, the 
      introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of mRCC has 
      improved outcomes for patients. This has brought forth new exploration of the 
      role of CN in combination with immunotherapy. Early retrospective evidence 
      suggests that there may be a benefit of deferred CN after immunotherapy (IOT) for 
      de novo mRCC patients. However, there has also been concern regarding the 
      feasibility of surgery after IOT due to inflammation. SBRT may be an appropriate 
      alternative in these circumstances. Since 1999, cytoreductive SBRT has been used 
      for inoperable primary RCC. Several prospective and retrospective studies 
      treating the kidney tumor for localized RCC have shown that this technique is 
      safe and produces favorable and durable local control. SBRT has also exhibited 
      similar effectiveness to CN, while providing additional benefits including 
      noninvasiveness and the ability to treat tumors that can't be treated with 
      nephrectomy or ablation due to size or location. Furthermore, SBRT confers 
      immunostimulatory effects, which are hypothesized to work synergistically with 
      immunotherapy. Clinicians should consider SBRT a safe and reliable alternative to 
      CN for RCC patients. Ongoing studies are exploring the utility of SBRT for 
      treatment of the primary tumor in mRCC patients receiving standard of care 
      immunotherapy.

AB  - Veterinary medicines are routinely used within modern animal husbandry, which 
      results in frequent detections within animal manures and slurries. The 
      application of manures to land as a form of organic fertiliser presents a pathway 
      by which these bioactive chemicals can enter the environment. However, to date, 
      there is limited understanding regarding the influence of commonly used manure 
      application methods on veterinary medicine fate in soil systems. To bridge this 
      knowledge gap, a semi-field study was conducted to assess the influence of 
      commonly used application methods such as, broadcast, chisel sweep, and 
      incorporation on veterinary medicine losses to waters. A range of veterinary 
      medicines were selected and applied as a mixture; these were enrofloxacin, 
      florfenicol, lincomycin, meloxicam, oxytetracycline, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim 
      and tylosin. All the assessed veterinary medicines were detected within surface 
      runoff and leachates, and the concentrations generally decreased throughout the 
      irrigation period. The surface runoff concentrations ranged from 0.49 to 
      183.47 μg/L and 2.26-236.83 μg/L for the bare soil and grass assessments 
      respectively. The leachate concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 309.66 μg/L and 
      0.33-37.79 μg/L for the bare soil and grass assessments respectively. More 
      advanced application methods (chisel sweep) were found to significantly reduce 
      the mass loads of veterinary medicines transported to surface runoff and leachate 
      by 13-56% and 49-88% over that of broadcast. Incorporating pig slurries reduced 
      the losses further with surface runoff and leachate losses being 13-56% and 
      49-88% lower than broadcast. Our results show that manure application techniques 
      have a significant effect on veterinary medicine fate in the environment and as 
      such these effects should be considered in the decision-making processes for the 
      management of manures as well as from a risk mitigation perspective for aquatic 
      compartments.

AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV), the causative agent of Aujeszky's disease, has gained 
      increased attention in China in recent years due to outbreaks of emergent 
      pseudorabies. However, there is limited information about the evolution and 
      pathogenicity of emergent PRV field strains in China. In this study, two PRV 
      field strains were isolated from an intensive pig farm with suspected PRV 
      infection. These were named the GXLB-2015 and GXGG-2016 strains and their growth 
      characteristics together with their genome sequences and pathogenicity were 
      determined. Nucleotide homology and phylogenetic analysis revealed the GXLB-2015 
      stain was relatively close to the foreign PRV isolated strains with respect to 
      the whole genome sequence. However, it formed an independent branch between the 
      foreign PRV isolates and the previous PRV variants isolated in China. Further 
      recombination and genetic evolution analysis showed that the GXLB-2015 strain was 
      a natural recombinant between the Bartha strain and PRV variants. The GXGG-2016 
      strain was highly homologous with the Chinese classical strains, but it has a 
      natural deletion of 69 aa in the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Pathogenicity 
      analysis showed that, the GXLB-2015 strain had the strongest pathogenicity to 
      mice with an LD(50) of 10(3.5), while the GXGG-2016 strain with the TK gene 
      deletion was not pathogenic to mice. Taken together, our data provide direct 
      evidence for the genomic recombination and natural TK gene deletion of PRVs, 
      which may provide a reference for a better understanding of PRV evolution in 
      China and contribute to the clinical control of PRV infection in pig farms.

AB  - The electrochemical biosensing strategy for pyocyanin (PYO), a virulent 
      quorum-sensing molecule responsible for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, was 
      developed by mimicking its extracellular DNA interaction. Calf thymus DNA 
      (ct-DNA) functionalized amine-containing carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were used as 
      a biomimetic receptor for electrochemical sensing of PYO as low as 37 nM in real 
      urine sample. The ct-DNA-based biosensor enabled the selective measurement of PYO 
      in the presence of other interfering species. Calibration and validation of the 
      PYO sensor platform were demonstrated in buffer solution (0-100 μM), microbial 
      culture media (0-100 μM), artificial urine (0-400 μM), and real urine sample 
      (0-250 μM). The sensor capability was successfully implemented for point-of-care 
      (POC) detection of PYO release from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains during lag and 
      stationary phases. Cross-reactivity of the sensing platform was also tested in 
      other bacterial species such as Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella 
      pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae. Potential clinical implementation of the ct-DNA-based sensor was 
      manifested in detecting the PYO in P. aeruginosa cultured baby diaper and 
      sanitary napkin. Our results highlight that the newly developed ct-DNA-based 
      sensing platform can be used as a potential candidate for real-time POC diagnosis 
      of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in clinical samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a low-grade, chronic inflammatory 
      disease, associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this 
      systematic review/ meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of aerobic exercise 
      training (AET) on inflammatory markers in T2DM patients. METHODS: The literature 
      search was conducted utilizing PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane 
      Library from their inception up to April 2022. We screened only for randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of AET on C-reactive protein 
      (CRP) and adipokines: adiponectin, resistin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha (TNF-a), along with changes in anthropometric indices and glycemic 
      control in adult T2DM patients. Pooled post-exercise weighted mean differences 
      (WMDs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated for all outcomes of 
      interest between exercise-treated patients and controls. RESULTS: Twenty-six RCTs 
      involving 1239 T2DM patients were retrieved from the databases for meta-analysis. 
      The cumulative results showed that post-AET inflammatory markers were lower in 
      exercise-treated patients compared to controls regarding CRP (mg/L): WMD: -0.91; 
      95%CIs: -1.43, -0.40; p < 0.001 resistin (mg/ml): (WMD: -2.08; 95%CIs: -3.32, 
      -0.84; p < 0.001); TNF-a (pg/ml): (WMD: -2.70; 95%CIs: -4.26, -1.14; p < 0.001), 
      and IL-6 (pg/ml): (WMD: -1.05; 95%CIs: -1.68, -0.43; p < 0.001). Those effects 
      were accompanied by significant amelioration of fasting glucose (mg/dl) (WMD: 
      -13.02; 95%CIs: -25.39, -0.66; p = 0.04), HbA1c (%) (WMD: -0.51; 95%CIs: -0.73, 
      -0.28, p < 0.001), and fat mass (%) (WMD: -3.14; 95%CI: -4.71, -1.58; p < 0.001). 
      Our meta-analysis demonstrated less-consistent results for adiponectin (μg/ml), 
      (WMD: 1.00; 95%CI: -0.12, 2.12; p = 0.08) and body-mass index (kg/m(2)) (WMD: 
      -1.34; 95%CI: -2.76, 0.08; p = 0.06) tending to differ between AET and control 
      group. CONCLUSIONS: AET can significantly reduce the inflammatory burden in T2DM 
      patients. by ameliorating the circulating levels of CRP, resistin, TNF-a and 
      IL-6, even without accompanied significant weight-loss. The clinical impact of 
      those anti-inflammatory effects of AET needs to be determined.

AB  - It is well-known that functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-12B 
      gene might intensely change the protein expression level, or modify its 
      functions, which might result in immune disorders. The association between common 
      IL-12B SNPs with preeclampsia (PE) risk has remained unclear yet. In a 
      case-control study, 253 PE patients and 250 healthy subjects were genotyped for 
      SNPs in IL-12B rs3212227 by PCR-RFLP and in IL-12B rs6887695 by AS-PCR. Novel 
      in-silico analysis were performed to predict the potential functions of these 
      polymorphisms, as well. The rs3212227 variation in IL12B gene showed an 
      association with susceptibility to PE. The AC and CC genotypes and also C allele 
      of this SNP were more frequent in patients. Likewise, they were frequent in early 
      onset and late onset PE. The G allele and GC and CC genotype of rs6887695 SNP 
      correlated negatively with PE development and it shown protective effect on PE 
      risk. In addition, the AG and CC haplotypes of IL-12B were more prevalent in PE 
      patients. Then, IL12B AC haplotype was less frequent in PE compare to healthy 
      pregnant women. In-silico analysis of IL-12B rs3212227 gene polymorphism might 
      not have significant impact on the mRNA structure and transcription of IL-12B. 
      The results of our study revealed a significant relationship between rs3212227A/C 
      and rs6887695G/C polymorphisms in IL-12B gene and the risk of PE in the Iranian 
      population.

AB  - Various studies have investigated the risk of preeclampsia with the forkhead box 
      protein P3 (FOXP3) gene rs2232365 and rs3761548 polymorphisms. However, the 
      results remained contradictory. A comprehensive literature search was conducted 
      using the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science (up to Oct 11, 2021). 
      Meta-analysis was carried out in the R language environment for statistical 
      computing and graphics. A fixed-effect or random-effects model was used according 
      to the statistical significance of heterogeneity among included studies. The 
      pooled odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated to 
      estimate the strength of the effect. For the rs2232365 polymorphism, statistical 
      significance was detected neither in the overall population nor among the East 
      Asian and West Asian subgroups. However, for rs3761548, the summarized statistics 
      revealed a significant association between the C allele carriage and preeclampsia 
      risk in the homozygote, heterozygote, and dominant models. The further stratified 
      analysis found this effect might be specific to West-South Asian ethnic 
      subgroups. To sum up, this meta-analysis showed that the FOXP3 rs3761548 
      polymorphism was significantly associated with preeclampsia susceptibility, and 
      it had a deleterious effect especially in the West-South Asian population. In 
      contrast, rs2232365 may serve as neither a protective nor a risk factor for 
      preeclampsia onset.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the effect and mechanism 
      responsible for how curcumin affects the biofilm formation by Streptococcus 
      mutans (S. mutans). DESIGN: The antibacterial activity of curcumin was evaluated 
      by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum 
      bactericidal concentration (MBC). The mass of the biofilm was measured by crystal 
      violet staining. Transcriptome sequencing was used to obtain all the transcript 
      information associated with the biological activity of curcumin-treated S. 
      mutans. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine the 
      expression levels of related biofilm formation genes. RESULTS: The MIC value for 
      curcumin was 64 μM. Curcumin inhibited the formation of a biofilm by S. mutans 
      and degraded mature biofilms. A gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the 
      DEGs were significantly relevant to biofilm formation. In addition, 17 
      significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways 
      (p ≤ 0.01) were identified and were potentially associated with the biochemical 
      metabolic processes of S. mutans. DEGs associated with the biofilm formation of 
      S. mutants, including gtfB, gtfC, rgpG, spaP, spxA1, spxA2, bacA, lrgB, and 
      gshAB. The qRT-PCR results were consistent with transcriptome sequencing that the 
      expression levels of gtfB, gtfC, rgpG, and spaP significantly decreased in the 
      curcumin-treated group, whereas the expression levels of spx1, spx2, bacA, lrgB, 
      and gshAB were up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin showed marked inhibitory 
      effects against the formation of biofilms by S. mutans and degradation of formed 
      biofilms.

AB  - Lipid oxidation induced protein scission was investigated in oleogel using 
      beta-lactoglobulin (whey protein isolate) as gelator. Extracted cleaved peptides 
      were measured using high resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), which was 
      provided by an automatically generated annotation list approach to identify 
      relevant masses and sum formula using the isotopic pattern. The identified 
      oxidized peptides were then further evaluated using partial least squares 
      regression to relevant lipid hydroperoxide formation data, which provide the 
      significance and importance of the peptides toward lipid induced scission. 
      Thereby, the most important peptides are located at the surface of the protein in 
      random coil segments and especially at the ends of the protein sequence. The most 
      important amino acids were cysteine and aliphatic amino acids, which undergo 
      scission mostly by the α-amidation pathway. The findings compare well with 
      studies investigating depletion of amino acids initiated by lipid oxidation in 
      systems containing bovine albumin or gamma-globulin.

AB  - Agavins (fructans from the agave plant) are used for their technological and 
      prebiotic properties in developing functional foods. In this study, four 
      extraction methods were evaluated: ultrasound (U), microwave (M), simultaneous 
      ultrasound-microwave (UM), and heat treatment (HT). Isomers with a degree of 
      polymerization (DP) > 10, as well as a significant concentration of 
      fructooligosaccharides (FOS) were identified. The yield obtained by UM (72%) was 
      similar to the other methods; however, the extraction time was shorter (5 min). 
      In U, M, and HT the yields were 86, 76, and 85% in 35, 30, and 180 min, 
      respectively. In addition, FTIR spectra showed evidence of regions corresponding 
      to fatty acids and carbohydrates. Therefore, using UM to obtain agavins is a more 
      ecological and faster process.

AB  - Herein, we reported the room-temperature fabrication of ionic liquid-modified 
      carbon dots encapsulated in bionic antibodies (IL-modified CDs@BAs) by one-pot 
      green synthesis. In order to enhance the fluorescence intensity of CDs, imidazole 
      ILs and lemon rich in heteroatoms were selected as CDs modifiers and sources. The 
      resulting IL-modified CDs@BAs showed good selectivity and capture toward urea and 
      obviously induced fluorescence quenching by template-binding. The inhibition rate 
      ofIL-modified CDs@BAs on the urea pathway of ethyl carbamate was about 29.07% in 
      the simulated Huangjiu system, indicating a good inhibitory effect. The 
      IL-modified CDs@BAs system was also reproducible after five consecutive uses, 
      thus reducing the economic cost. This research would expand the application 
      fields of BAs-based optical sensing system from the perspectives of energy 
      conservation, environmental protection and resource recovery, focusing on their 
      application in the field of food safety control.

AB  - NPHP1 (Nephrocystin 1) is a protein that localizes to the transition zone of the 
      cilium, a small organelle that projects from the plasma membrane of most cells 
      and allows for integration and coordination of signalling pathways during 
      development and homeostasis. Loss of NPHP1 function due to biallelic NPHP1 gene 
      mutations can lead to the development of ciliopathies - a heterogeneous spectra 
      of disorders characterized by ciliary dysfunction. Here we report the generation 
      of an NPHP1-null hiPSC line (UCSFi001-A-68) via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated 
      non-homologous end joining in the UCSFi001-A background, for study of the role 
      that this protein plays in different tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood and adolescent mental health problems may increase the 
      global burden of disease. Neurotoxic metals are associated with inflammation and 
      cytotoxicity in the brain. In addition, prenatal phthalate ester (PAE) exposure 
      is associated with cognitive function deficits. However, the effect of 
      co-exposure to toxic metals, PAEs, and their association with child behavior is 
      less well studied. Hence, we aimed to investigate prenatal co-exposure to the 
      metals and PAEs and the consequent behavioral outcomes in early childhood. 
      METHODS: We followed pregnant women and their newborns from the Taiwan Maternal 
      and Infant Cohort Study between 2015 and 2017, with a focus on women from the 
      central, southern, and eastern areas of Taiwan. We quantified maternal urinary 
      concentrations of metals and metabolites of PAEs as surrogates of prenatal 
      exposure. We recorded the Child Behavior Checklist scores according to caregiver 
      reports at 4 years of age, and identified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
      Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)-oriented problems. RESULTS: Ultimately, 
      408 children were included in the statistical analysis. Maternal urinary copper 
      levels were significantly associated with depressive problems (odds ratio 
      [OR] = 2.13) in children. Maternal urinary concentrations of mono-n-butyl 
      phthalate (MnBP) and mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) were also significantly 
      associated with depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.51 and 1.53, 
      respectively). Further analysis considering prenatal co-exposure to metals and 
      PAEs showed that co-exposure to these materials was significantly associated with 
      autism spectrum problems (OR = 3.11). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that prenatal 
      single exposure or co-exposure to metals and PAEs may play a role in some 
      DSM-5-oriented problems in children at 4 years of age. Reduction of exposure to 
      toxic metals and PAEs in pregnancy is suggested to prevent increased mental 
      health problems in children.

AB  - Human health risk assessment of chemicals is essential but often relies on 
      time-consuming and animal and labor-extensive procedures. Here, we develop a 
      population-based, quantitative in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (QIVIVE) 
      approach which depended on cellular effects monitored by in vitro assays, 
      considered chemical internal concentration determined by LC-MS/MS, extrapolated 
      into in vivo target tissue concentration through physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, and assessed populational health risk using in 
      silico modelling. By applying this QIVIVE approach to 6:2 chlorinated 
      polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA), as a representative of the 
      emerging pollutants, we find that 6:2 Cl-PFESA disturbed lipid homeostasis in 
      HepG2 cells through enhancement of lipid accumulation and fatty acid β-oxidation, 
      during which miR-93-5p served as a key event towards toxicity and thus, could 
      serve as an efficient toxicity marker for risk assessment; further, the 
      disruption potency of lipid homeostasis of 6:2 Cl-PFESA for the most of studied 
      populations in China might be of moderate concern. Together, our approach 
      improved the reliability of QIVIVE during human health risk assessment, which can 
      readily be used for other chemicals.

AB  - Air pollution concentrations in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) have been found to 
      surpass the WHO standard, which has become a very serious problem affecting human 
      health and the ecosystem. Various machine learning algorithms have recently been 
      widely used in air quality forecasting studies to predict possible impacts. 
      Training and constructing several machine learning models for different air 
      pollutants, such as NO(2), SO(2), O(3), and CO forecasts, is a time-consuming 
      process that necessitates additional effort for deployment, maintenance, and 
      monitoring. In this paper, an effort has been made to develop a multi-step 
      multi-output multivariate model (a global model) for air quality forecasting, 
      taking into account various parameters such as meteorological conditions, air 
      quality data from urban traffic, residential, and industrial areas, urban space 
      information, and time component for the prediction of NO(2), SO(2), O(3), CO 
      hourly (1 h to 24 h) concentrations. The global forecasting model can anticipate 
      multiple air pollutant concentrations concurrently, based on past concentrations 
      of covariate characteristics. The datasets on air pollution time series were 
      gathered from six HealthyAir air quality monitoring sites in HCMC between 
      February 2021 and August 2022. Darksky weather provided the hourly concentrations 
      of meteorological conditions for the same period. This is the first model built 
      using real-time air quality data for NO(2), SO(2), CO, and O(3) forecasting in 
      HCM city. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, it was evaluated 
      using real data from HealthyAir stations and quantified using Root Mean Squared 
      Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and correlation indices. The 
      results show that the global air quality forecasting model beats earlier models 
      built for air quality forecasting of each specific pollutant in HCMC.

AB  - Agriculture-related manufactured nano-objects (MNOs) can revolutionize the crop 
      production and help to achieve sustainable development goals. MNOs with diverse 
      physico-chemical properties and ability to encapsulate and deliver active 
      ingredients in controlled, targeted and stimuli responsive manner can enhance the 
      efficiency while minimizing collateral damage to non-target organisms and 
      environment. Application of MNOs in the form of nanopesticides and 
      nanofertilizers is known to affect soil microbial communities both positively and 
      negatively, but detailed studies with varying dose, type and environmental 
      conditions are scarce. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the complex 
      mechanisms and factors which shape the MNOs-microbial interactions through 
      integrating state of the art technologies including omics (transcriptomics, 
      metabolomics, and proteomics), artificial intelligence, and statistical 
      frameworks. Lastly, we propose the idea of MNOs-mediated manipulation of soil 
      microbiome to modify the soil microbial communities for improved microbial 
      services. These microbial services, if harnessed appropriately, can revolutionize 
      modern agriculture and help in achieving sustainable development goals.

AB  - Naturally occurring oxides could react with zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) 
      and then change its transformation and toxicity to ecological receptors. The 
      reaction may be affected by a variety of environmental factors, yet the relevant 
      processes and mechanisms are limitedly investigated. Natural prevalent ligands, 
      as an important factor, can sorb on natural oxide minerals and change its surface 
      property, finally affecting ZnO NP transformation. This study investigated the 
      interactions of ZnO NPs with phosphorus ligands (i.e., phytate and 
      orthophosphate) pre-sorbed γ-alumina (γ-Al(2)O(3)) via batch experiments and 
      multi-technique analyses. A limited amount of aqueous Zn(2+) is observed when the 
      concentration of ZnO NPs is relatively low (<64.8 mg L(-1)) in the presence of 
      phytate pre-sorbed γ-Al(2)O(3). Solid Zn(II) species includes binary/ternary 
      surface Zn(II) complexes on γ-Al(2)O(3) with minor amounts of zinc phytate 
      precipitates. As the concentration of ZnO NPs increases, surface Zn(II) complexes 
      gradually transform into zinc phytate and Zn-Al layered double hydroxide (Zn-Al 
      LDH) precipitates. The quantitative analysis indicates that, as the concentration 
      of ZnO NPs increases from 32.4 to 388.8 mg L(-1), the proportion of Zn(II) 
      species as binary/ternary surface complexes decreases from 81.9 to 30.2%; and the 
      proportion as zinc phytate and Zn-Al LDH increases from 17.9 to 27.6% and 0 to 
      43.8%, respectively. The pre-sorption of orthophosphate can also inhibit ZnO NP 
      transformation into Zn-Al LDH precipitates on γ-Al(2)O(3). This study suggests 
      that natural ligands pre-existed on natural oxide minerals could greatly 
      influence the solubility, stability, transformation, and fate of easily 
      dissoluble metal oxides (e.g., ZnO) in the environments.

AB  - Identify risk drivers is the key condition in air pollution control, and 
      biological effect-directed analysis is the most commented method for combing 
      chemical identify and human health. The water-soluble organic matter contained in 
      PM(2.5) plays an important role in human health, while it is also the most 
      difficult to identify its chemical information. Exploring the structural 
      characteristics and pollution sources of its key toxic components is the 
      optimized strategy to meet this question. In this study, the induction of 
      apoptosis by the water-soluble fractions (WSF) of PM(2.5) samples collected in 10 
      major cities in China over a period of 1 year was observed in vitro in Beas-2b 
      cells. Organic carbon structures were examined using nuclear magnetic resonance; 
      air potential sources were identified using δ(13)C and (14)C isotopic markers. 
      Apoptosis induction by WSF in PM(2.5) was generally stronger in northern cities 
      than in southern cities, and in winter than in summer. Organic compounds with 
      aromatic and double-bond carbon structures from secondary products of motor 
      vehicle exhausts, coal-derived emissions, and emissions derived from the burning 
      of core residues may be primarily responsible for apoptosis induction by PM(2.5). 
      Our results will contribute to understanding the toxic substances contained in 
      WSF and provide basic data for accurate pollution control.

AB  - The Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) onboard the recently launched 
      Chinese Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite has great capability in detecting global 
      aerosols as it includes aerosol bands similar to Moderate Resolution Imaging 
      Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, to date, aerosol retrieval based on MERSI-II 
      is still limited to dark target regions and there is no official aerosol products 
      for the MERSI-II. This study focuses on developing a high-precision algorithm to 
      retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) suitable for entire land areas (except 
      snow/ice and inland waters) based on MERSI-II measurements. Considering both the 
      accuracy and retrieval efficiency, a new cost function is constructed based on 
      (1) the fact that the AOD (550 nm) retrieved independently from different bands 
      should be the same with the correct aerosol model, and (2) the assumption that 
      the aerosol types are the same in the 5 × 5 km spatial range. The retrieval 
      method based on the new cost function is nearly 50 times faster than most current 
      methods using iterative calculations. To extend the application adaption of the 
      FY-3D MERSI-II AOD retrieval and avoid the errors caused by the surface 
      Lambertian hypothesis, a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) 
      database is built using MODIS products. Eight candidate aerosol models in 
      different natural zones of China are constructed based on AERONET aerosol 
      products from 2010 - 2021. The new method is applied to MERSI-II images over 
      China and validated against ground-based measurements at 14 stations from 2020 to 
      2021. MODIS aerosol products from three operational algorithms are also used for 
      comparison purposes. The results show that MERSI-II AOD retrievals agree well 
      with the ground-based measurements with correlation coefficient (R), root mean 
      square error (RMSE), and relative mean bias (RMB) of 0.913, 0.123, and 0.955, 
      respectively. In addition, 72.19 % of AOD matchups fall within the expected error 
      (EE) envelopes. The MERSI-II retrievals show higher accuracy than that of MODIS 
      dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) products and comparable accuracy of the MODIS 
      Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) product. MERSI-II 
      AOD also shows higher stability in terms of spatial and temporal and better 
      performance under heavy aerosol loading conditions than MODIS products. A good 
      AOD agreement with R from 0.777 to 0.863 between MERSI-II and MODIS products is 
      found over the land of China. The new method showing high retrieval efficiency 
      and accuracy has great potential to be operationally applied on AOD retrieval for 
      MERSI-II.

AB  - Type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is an intracellular Ca(2+) release channel on 
      the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle, and it plays a central role in 
      excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. Mutations in RyR1 are implicated in 
      various muscle diseases including malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, 
      and myopathies. Currently, no specific treatment exists for most of these 
      diseases. Recently, high-throughput screening (HTS) assays have been developed 
      for identifying potential candidates for treating RyR-related muscle diseases. 
      Currently, two different methods, namely a FRET-based assay and an endoplasmic 
      reticulum Ca(2+)-based assay, are available. These assays identified several 
      compounds as novel RyR1 inhibitors. In addition, the development of a 
      reconstituted platform permitted HTS assays for E-C coupling modulators. In this 
      review, we will focus on recent progress in HTS assays and discuss future 
      perspectives of these promising approaches.

AB  - Gastro-esophageal tumors constitute a big health problem. Treatment options still 
      mainly rely on chemotherapy, and apart from human epidermal growth factor 
      receptor 2 positive and microsatellite instable/Epstein-Barr Virus disease, there 
      are no molecularly guided options. Therefore, despite the large number of 
      identified molecular alterations, precision medicine is still far from the 
      clinic. In this context, the recently developed technology of patient-derived 
      organoids (PDOs) could offer the chance to accelerate drug development and 
      biomarker discovery. Indeed, PDOs are 3D primary cultures that were shown to 
      reproduce patient's tumor characteristics. Moreover, several reports indicated 
      that PDOs can replicate patient's response to a given drug; therefore, they are 
      one of the most promising tools for functional precision medicine.

AB  - Dystrophinopathy and sarcoglycanopathies are incurable diseases caused by 
      mutations in the genes encoding dystrophin or members of the dystrophin 
      associated protein complex (DAPC). Restoration of the missing dystrophin or 
      sarcoglycans via genetic approaches is complicated by the downsides of 
      personalised medicines and immune responses against re-expressed proteins. Thus, 
      the targeting of disease mechanisms downstream from the mutant protein has a 
      strong translational potential. Acute muscle damage causes release of large 
      quantities of ATP, which activates P2X7 purinoceptors, resulting in inflammation 
      that clears dead tissues and triggers regeneration. However, in dystrophic 
      muscles, loss of α-sarcoglycan ecto-ATPase activity further elevates 
      extracellular ATP (eATP) levels, exacerbating the pathology. Moreover, seemingly 
      compensatory P2X7 upregulation in dystrophic muscle cells, combined with high 
      eATP leads to further damage. Accordingly, P2X7 blockade alleviated dystrophic 
      damage in mouse models of both dystrophinopathy and sarcoglycanopathy. Existing 
      P2X7 blockers could be re-purposed for the treatment of these highly debilitating 
      diseases.

TI  - PACAP inhibition alleviates neuropathic pain by modulating Nav1.7 through the 
      MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in a rat model of chronic constriction injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia is a common chronic maxillofacial neuropathic 
      pain disorder, and voltage-gated sodium channels (VSGCs) are likely involved in 
      its pathology. Prior studies report that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating 
      polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide highly expressed in the trigeminal ganglion, 
      may contribute to dorsal root ganglion neuron excitability by modulating the 
      Nav1.7. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether PACAP can regulate Nav1.7 through the 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 
      (MEK/ERK) pathway in the trigeminal ganglion after chronic constriction injury of 
      the infraorbital nerve (ION-CCI) in rats. STUDY DESIGN: Sprague-Dawley rats 
      underwent ION-CCI, followed by intrathecal injection of PACAP 6-38 (PAC1 receptor 
      antagonist) and PD98059 (MEK/ERK antagonist). Quantitative real-time PCR and 
      western blot were used to quantify ATF3, PACAP, ERK, p-ERK, and Nav1.7 
      expression. RESULTS: The mechanical pain threshold decreased from day 3 to day 21 
      after ION-CCI and reached the lowest testing value by day 14; however, it 
      increased after PACAP 6-38 and PD98059 injections. Additionally, ION-CCI surgery 
      increased ATF3, PACAP, and p-ERK expression in the rat trigeminal ganglion and 
      decreased Nav1.7 and PAC1 receptor expression; however, there was no difference 
      in ERK expression. PACAP 6-38 injection significantly decreased PACAP, p-ERK, and 
      Nav1.7 expression and increased the PAC1 receptor expression, with no change in 
      ERK expression. Moreover, PD98059 injection decreased PACAP, p-ERK, and Nav1.7 
      expression and increased the expression of PAC1 receptor. CONCLUSION: After 
      ION-CCI, PACAP in the rat trigeminal ganglion can modulate Nav1.7 through the 
      MEK/ERK pathway via the PAC1 receptor. Further, PACAP inhibition alleviates 
      allodynia in ION-CCI rats.

AB  - Vocabulary is based on semantic knowledge. The anterior temporal lobe (ATL) has 
      been considered an essential region for processing semantic knowledge; 
      nonetheless, the association between word production patterns and the structural 
      and functional characteristics of the ATL remains unclear. To examine this, we 
      analyzed over one million words from group conversations among community-dwelling 
      older adults and their multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data. A quantitative 
      index for the word production patterns, namely the exponent β of Heaps' law, 
      positively correlated with the left anterior middle temporal gyrus volume. 
      Moreover, β negatively correlated with its resting-state functional connectivity 
      with the precuneus. There was no significant correlation with the diffusion 
      tensor imaging metrics in any fiber. These findings suggest that the vocabulary 
      richness in spoken language depends on the brain status characterized by the 
      semantic knowledge-related brain structure and its activation dissimilarity with 
      the precuneus, a core region of the default mode network.

AB  - The rapid development of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens adds urgency to 
      search for novel and safe drugs having promising action on new and re-emerging 
      infectious pathogens. Serratia marcescens is an MDR pathogen that causes 
      several-healthcare associated infections. Curbing bacterial virulence, rather 
      than inhibiting its growth, is a promising strategy to diminish the pathogenesis 
      of infectious bacteria, reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance, and 
      boost the host immune power to eradicate infections. Bergamot essential oil (BEO) 
      is a remarkable source of promising therapeutics against pathogens. Therefore, 
      the present investigation aimed to analyze the major phytocompounds from BEO 
      against S. marcescens virulent proteins using in silico studies. The analysis of 
      BEO phytocompounds was achieved by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) 
      method. The molecular docking was carried out using the SP and XP docking 
      protocol of the Glide program. The drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics properties 
      (ADMET properties) were analyzed with SwissADME and pkCSM server. The results 
      revealed that the major compounds present in BEO are Linalool (8.17%), D-Limonene 
      (21.26%), and Linalyl acetate (26.91%). Molecular docking analysis revealed that 
      these compounds docked strongly within the binding cavities of Serratia protease 
      and FabI model which in turn curb the pathogenesis of this bacteria. Linalool 
      interacted with the Serratia protease and FabI with a binding energy of 
      - 3.130 kcal/mol and - 3.939 kcal/mol, respectively. Based on the 
      pharmacokinetics findings all lead BEO phytocompounds appear to be promising drug 
      candidates. Overall, these results represent a significant step in the 
      development of plant-based compounds as a promising inhibitor of the virulent 
      proteins of the MDR S. marcescens.

AB  - Nucleoside analogs/derivatives (NAs/NDs) with potent antiviral activities are now 
      deemed very convenient choices for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) arisen by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. At the same time, the appearance of a new strain of 
      SARS-CoV-2, the Omicron variant, necessitates multiplied efforts in fighting 
      COVID-19. Counteracting the crucial SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RNA-dependent RNA 
      polymerase (RdRp) and 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) jointly altogether using 
      the same inhibitor is a quite successful new plan to demultiplicate SARS-CoV-2 
      particles and eliminate COVID-19 whatever the SARS-CoV-2 subtype is (due to the 
      significant conservation nature of RdRps and ExoNs in the different SARS-CoV-2 
      strains). Successive in silico screening of known NAs finally disclosed six 
      different promising NAs, which are 
      riboprine/forodesine/tecadenoson/nelarabine/vidarabine/maribavir, respectively, 
      that predictably can act through the planned dual-action mode. Further in vitro 
      evaluations affirmed the anti-SARS-CoV-2/anti-COVID-19 potentials of these NAs, 
      with riboprine and forodesine being at the top. The two NAs are able to 
      effectively antagonize the replication of the new virulent SARS-CoV-2 strains 
      with considerably minute in vitro anti-RdRp and anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC(50) values of 
      189 and 408 nM for riboprine and 207 and 657 nM for forodesine, respectively, 
      surpassing both remdesivir and the new anti-COVID-19 drug molnupiravir. 
      Furthermore, the favorable structural characteristics of the two molecules 
      qualify them for varied types of isosteric and analogistic chemical 
      derivatization. In one word, the present important outcomes of this comprehensive 
      dual study revealed the anticipating repurposing potentials of some known 
      nucleosides, led by the two NAs riboprine and forodesine, to successfully 
      discontinue the coronaviral-2 polymerase/exoribonuclease interactions with RNA 
      nucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (BA.5 sublineage) and accordingly 
      alleviate COVID-19 infections, motivating us to initiate the two drugs' diverse 
      anti-COVID-19 pharmacological evaluations to add both of them betimes in the 
      COVID-19 therapeutic protocols.

AB  - Uncontrolled bleeding and bacterial infections cause severe damage to the wounds 
      and remain a clinical challenge. Here, we developed a nanofiber/sponge bilayered 
      composite membrane (QCP) containing quaternized silicone (QP12) and quaternized 
      chitosan (QCS12) by joint approaches of electrospinning and freeze-drying and 
      investigated their potential for wound dressing. The QCP was composed of a sponge 
      (QCC) containing collagen (COL) and QCS12 and a nanofibrous membrane (MQP) 
      containing poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) and QP12. The QCP composite membrane 
      possessed feasible permeability (0.22 ± 0.01 g/(cm(2)·24 h)), available thermal 
      stability, suitable mechanical properties with natural skin, and in vivo 
      hemostatic efficiency. The bonds of the N-quaternary and Schiff base endow 
      composite membranes with significant anti-microbial invasion, potentially 
      enhancing the wound healing process with an eligible microenvironment. Meanwhile, 
      QCP evinced fine hemocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, negligible skin irritation, 
      and other desirable biosafety as an excellent wound dressing. QCP promoted 
      collagen deposition and re-epithelization to accelerate healing and suppress 
      scars in the full-thickness acute wound models. Furthermore, the evaluation in 
      the chronic skin incision model of diabetes mellitus manifested high healing 
      efficiency with a certain resistance to bacterial infection of the composite 
      membrane. Taken together, the QCP composite membrane may be a potential 
      antibacterial and hemostatic wound dressing.

AB  - Microplastic pollution of the ocean has received extensive attention as plastic 
      pollution increases globally, but the potential ecological risks caused by 
      microplastic interactions with trace metals still require further research. In 
      this study, Apostichopus japonicus was used to explore the individual and 
      combined toxicities of cadmium (Cd) and microplastics and their effects on 
      growth, Cd tissue accumulation, digestive enzymes, and gut microbes. The body 
      weight gain and specific growth rate of animals exposed to a combination of high 
      concentrations of Cd and microplastics decreased. The addition of high 
      concentrations of cadmium to the diet led to an increase in cadmium content in 
      the respiratory tree, digestive tract and body wall. Amylase, lipase and trypsin 
      decreased to different degrees in the group treated with high concentrations of 
      Cd/microplastics. Firmicutes were significantly reduced across multiple treatment 
      groups, with the order Lactobacillales being the most significantly affected. Cd 
      is the pollutant causing the greatest negative impact, but the presence of 
      microplastics undoubtedly increases its toxicity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Bekhterev's disease, or ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 
      is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease closely related to the human 
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. Cardiac damage in AS occurs in 2-10 % of patients 
      more commonly as aortic insufficiency, aortitis, mitral valve fibrosis, or 
      cardiac conduction abnormalities. CASE PRESENTATION: In this article we present a 
      clinical case of a 52-year-old female patient with Bekhterev's disease, who 
      underwent aortic valve reconstruction with autopericardium and mitral homograft 
      implantation in mitral position. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The use of homografts and 
      reconstructive surgeries using autologous materials allow not only avoiding 
      lifelong intake of anticoagulants, but also maintaining hemodynamic profile 
      comparable to that of native valves. CONCLUSION: This clinical case shows that 
      treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases is a complex treatment problem that 
      requires a personalized approach.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Paravertebral abscess is a common complication of spondylitis 
      tuberculosis which has high prevalence in Indonesia. Surgical intervention such 
      as open surgery or endoscopic debridement is needed to remove and drainage the 
      abscess in addition to chemotherapy. However, this surgeries have several 
      complications such as soft tissue damage and abscess contamination to the healthy 
      tissue. We reported closed system strategy to evacuate the paravertebral abscess 
      on spinal infection. METHODS: The technique is performed by orthopaedic team 
      under guidance of the C-Arm and ultrasound sonography (USG) in March-June 202. 
      The needle which connected to 20 cc syringe is inserted into the lesion to 
      aspirate the abscess. After evacuation of the abscess, 2-g broad spectrum 
      antibiotic is injected through the needle to eradicate the bacteria locally. 
      RESULTS: We performed the closed system paravertebral abscess evacuation in three 
      patients, a 30-year-old male, 43-year-old male, and 22-year-old female. All the 
      patients had back pain and limitation spine movement due to pain and were 
      diagnosed with spondylitis and paravertebral abscess based on the plain 
      radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It reported that up to 2000 cc 
      abscess can be evacuated with this micro invasive technique. CONCLUSION: The 
      closed system is a micro-invasive procedure result in minimal soft tissue injury 
      and faster recovery. It succesfully remove paravertebral abscess followed by 
      direct antibiotic eradication on spinal infection.

AB  - Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder 
      are body-focused repetitive behaviors, which often first present in adolescence 
      and cause distress and impairment into adulthood. Few studies have examined the 
      clinical characteristics of the co-occurrence of these conditions across the 
      lifespan. We examined cross-sectional survey responses collected from April 
      2018-February 2020 to evaluate the relationship between trichotillomania, 
      excoriation disorder, and their co-occurrence. Responses from individuals with 
      trichotillomania (n = 50), excoriation disorder (n = 52), and both conditions 
      (n = 50) ages 4-67 years old were compared for co-occurring conditions and 
      current symptoms. Self-report measures of hair-pulling and skin-picking severity 
      and subtypes were assessed. Gender, race, and co-occurring conditions were 
      generally similarly distributed across the three groups with high rates of 
      self-reported anxiety (63-82%), depression (34-50%), obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder (16-29%), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (12-32%). Among 
      individuals with both trichotillomania and excoriation disorder, significant 
      positive correlations were observed between hair-pulling and skin-picking 
      severity scores as well as hair-pulling and skin-picking subtypes. Hair-pulling 
      and skin-picking severity peaked at the transition from adolescence to adulthood 
      and hair-pulling/skin-picking styles appeared to shift across the lifespan. Our 
      results support several similarities between trichotillomania and excoriation 
      disorder, providing new insight into the clinical characteristics of these 
      conditions.

AB  - This work illustrates the advantages of using machine learning classifiers in 
      psychiatric assessment. Machine learning-decision trees (ML-DTs) represent a new 
      approach to scoring and interpreting psychodiagnostic test data that allows for 
      increasing assessment accuracy and efficiency. The approach is outlined in an 
      easy yet detailed way, and its application is illustrated on real 
      psychodiagnostic test data. Specifically, cross-sectional data concerning 
      nonclinical and clinical Japanese populations were taken from a panel registered 
      with an internet survey company. Responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
      (PHQ-9) underwent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, DSM algorithm, 
      and ML-DT analyses. The results showed greater diagnostic accuracy for ML-DT 
      (0.71-0.75) compared with the DSM algorithm (0.69) and ROC curves (0.70-0.71). 
      Moreover, ML-DT enabled classifying participants as having or not having a 
      diagnosis of depression using, on average, the information from 2.99 out of 9 
      items (SD = 1.35). The application showed that ML-DTs can provide information of 
      high clinical value to integrate traditional psychometric methods. The resulting 
      assessments are informative, accurate, and efficient.

AB  - The present study followed-up adolescents with social anxiety disorder (SAD) 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 5-years following their participation 
      in an Attention Bias Modification Training (ABMT) program (Ollendick et al., 
      2019). The current study aimed to evaluate current functioning and quality of 
      life (QoL) during the emerging adulthood period. Participants included 27 young 
      adults who completed a randomized controlled trial of ABMT and were available for 
      follow-up. Participants filled out self-report measures of QoL and functioning 
      and underwent a clinical interview to assess current severity of social anxiety. 
      Clinician-rated symptoms of SAD significantly decreased from post-treatment to 
      5-year follow-up. Additionally, results demonstrated that social anxiety severity 
      was significantly related to poorer self-reported physical and psychological 
      health as well as poorer functioning with regard to social distancing fears 
      during COVID-19. Lastly, when evaluating change in symptoms over time, increases 
      in social anxiety severity over a 5-year period significantly predicted worsened 
      social distancing fears during COVID-19.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) is one of many major global climate changes that pose a 
      variety of risks to marine ecosystems in different ways. Meanwhile, there is 
      growing concern about how nanoplastics (NPs) affect marine ecosystems. Combined 
      exposure of marine organisms to OA and NPs is inevitable, but their interactive 
      effects remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the multi- and 
      transgenerational toxicity of NPs on copepods under OA conditions for ten 
      generations. The findings revealed that OA and NPs have a synergistic negative 
      effect on copepod reproduction across generations. In particular, the 
      transgenerational groups showed reproductive impairments in the F1 and F2 
      generations (F1T and F2T), even though they were never exposed to NPs. Moreover, 
      our epigenetic examinations demonstrated that the observed intergenerational 
      reproductive impairments are associated with differential methylation patterns of 
      specific genes, suggesting that the interaction of OA and NPs can pose a 
      significant threat to the sustainability of copepod populations through 
      epigenetic modifications. Overall, our findings provide valuable insight into the 
      intergenerational toxicity and underlying molecular mechanisms of responses to 
      NPs under OA conditions.

AB  - Ligamentum flavum (LF) pathologies often lead to severe myelopathy or 
      radiculopathy characterized by reduced elasticity, obvious thickening, or 
      worsened ossification. Elastin endows critical mechanical properties to tissues 
      and organs such as vertebrae and ligaments. Desmosine (DES) and isodesmosine 
      (IDES) are crosslinkers of elastin monomers called tropoelastin. These 
      crosslinkers are potential biomarkers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
      As a biological diagnostic tool that supplements existing symptomatic, magnetic 
      resonance imaging scanning or radiological imaging diagnostic measures for LF 
      hypertrophy and associated pathologies, an isotope-dilution liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method with selected reaction monitoring 
      mode for the quantitation of DESs in human plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF), and yellow ligamentum was investigated. Isotopically labeled 
      IDES-(13)C(3),(15)N(1) was used as an internal standard (ISTD) for DES 
      quantitation for the first time. The samples plus ISTD were hydrolyzed with 6 N 
      hydrochloric acid. Analytes and ISTD were extracted using a solid phase 
      extraction cellulose cartridge column. The assays were repeatable, reproducible, 
      and accurate with % CV ≤ 7.7, ISTD area % RSD of 7.6, and % AC ≤ (101.2 ± 3.90) 
      of the calibrations. The ligamentum samples gave the highest average DES/IDES 
      content (2.38 μg/mg) on a dry-weight basis. A high percentage of the CSF samples 
      showed almost no DESs. Urine and plasma samples of patients showed no significant 
      difference from the control (p-value = 0.0519 and 0.5707, respectively). 
      Microscopy of the yellow ligamentum samples revealed dark or blue-colored zones 
      of elastin fibers that retained the hematoxylin dye and highly red-colored zones 
      of collagen after counterstaining with van Gieson solution. Thus, we successfully 
      developed a method for DES/IDES quantitation in clinical samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Home and community care service (HACCS) is an important policy 
      response worldwide to the growing and unmet care needs of the aging population. 
      In China, the government also started to implement a HACCS pilot program in 2016. 
      This study aims to evaluate the association of HACCS utilization with healthy 
      aging in Chinese older adults. METHODS: This study followed a quasi-experimental 
      design and derived data from the nationwide China Health and Retirement 
      Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in 2015 and 2018. We employed the propensity score 
      matching with difference-in-difference approach (PSM-DID) to examine the 
      association between HACCS and healthy aging indicators. RESULTS: A total of 8345 
      older adults were incorporated for a final sample. The results indicated that 
      HACCS utilization was associated with significantly reduced functional 
      limitations (β for BADL=-0.124, β for IADL=-0.210; P<0.01) and depression 
      (β=-0.386, P<0.05) as well as improved cognitive function (β=0.609, P<0.001), 
      life satisfaction (β=0.083, P<0.01) and social participation (β=0.105, P<0.01) in 
      older people, although its association with reduced disability was 
      non-significant (β=-0.005, P = 0.676). The heterogeneous tests further found that 
      rural older adults and older adults aged<80 were more likely than their 
      counterparts to benefit from the HACCS utilization in specific healthy aging 
      indicators such as cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the 
      HACCS program benefited a range of healthy aging domains among older adults in 
      China. Policymakers are encouraged to further expand the program implementation 
      and also continue to improve the services list and care quality of HACCS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed if personal human values and provision of 
      informal care were associated and if this differed as a function of gender or 
      age. METHOD: Data from the German Aging Survey were used (wave 2008, N=6,089), 
      which included 748 informal caregivers. Human values were measured with the Human 
      Values Scale from Schwartz (self-enhancement, self-transcendence, conservation, 
      openness to change). Adjusted logistic regression analyses (with gender and age 
      as additional moderators) were conducted. RESULTS: Placing higher importance on 
      conservation and self-enhancement values was associated with lower odds for 
      caregiving, while a higher appreciation of self-transcendence was associated with 
      higher odds of caregiving. With older age, a higher score in conservation values 
      was associated with even lower odds for caregiving. Gender did not moderate these 
      associations, still, lower odds of caregiving were found only among men with 
      higher scores in openness to change, and only among women with higher scores in 
      conservation values. Self-transcendence was associated with higher odds of 
      caregiving among both, men and women. DISCUSSION: In brief, personal values were 
      significantly associated with informal caregiving and may act as motivators or 
      barriers. The same motivators were found among men and women but different values 
      were associated with lower odds of providing care. When aiming to foster informal 
      care and a gender-equal distribution of caregiving, it could be helpful to take 
      these values into account.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High rates of suboptimal medication use exist in residential aged 
      care facilities (RACFs). Pharmacist interventions can improve medication 
      appropriateness. In 2023 there will be a phased implementation of pharmacists 
      working on-site in Australian RACFs. OBJECTIVE: To explore factors influencing 
      Australian pharmacists' interest and perceived preparedness to work as on-site 
      pharmacists in RACFs. METHODS: A national cross-sectional anonymous online survey 
      of Australian pharmacists was conducted. Pharmacists were recruited using a broad 
      advertising strategy. The 36-question survey included three free-text questions 
      that are the focus of this study. The questions asked participants (1) what 
      influenced their interest in the role, (2) what influenced how prepared they felt 
      for the role, and (3) if they had any other comments about the role. Responses 
      were thematically analysed by two investigators using an inductive approach. 
      RESULTS: Most survey respondents (n=546, 84.9%) answered at least one free-text 
      questions. Four factors influenced interest: on-site pharmacist role, aged care 
      setting, individual pharmacist circumstances and employment model. Four factors 
      influenced preparedness: familiarity with aged care setting, resident-level 
      clinical skills; ability to communicate and work with a multidisciplinary team, 
      and experience with system-level quality use of medicines activities. Four 
      factors important for successful roll-out emerged from the 'other comments': 
      pharmacist attributes, pharmacist workforce planning, resources and support, and 
      RACF stakeholder engagement. CONCLUSION: Key factors influencing pharmacist 
      interest and preparedness to work on-site in RACFs and factors important for 
      success were identified. These findings will support the national roll-out of the 
      role, particularly as most identified factors are currently modifiable.

AB  - Complex motion of the human thumb is enabled by the balanced architectural design 
      of the extrinsic and intrinsic thumb muscles. Given that recent imaging advances 
      have not yet been applied to enhance our understanding of the in vivo properties 
      of thumb muscles, the objective of this study was to test the reliability and 
      validity of measuring thumb muscle fascicle lengths using extended field of view 
      ultrasound (EFOV-US). Three muscles (FPL: flexor pollicis longus, APB: abductor 
      pollicis brevis, and ECU: extensor carpi ulnaris) were imaged in eight healthy 
      adults (4 female; age, 21.6 ± 1.3 years; height, 175.9 ± 8.3 cm)[mean ± SD]. 
      Measured fascicle lengths were compared to cadaveric data (all muscles) and 
      ultrasound data (ECU only). Additionally, to evaluate how fascicle lengths scale 
      with anthropometric measurements, height, forearm length, hand length, and hand 
      width were recorded. The EFOV-US method obtained precise fascicle length 
      measurements [mean ± SD] for the FPL (6.2 ± 0.5 cm), APB (5.1 ± 0.3 cm), and ECU 
      (4.0 ± 0.4 cm). However, our EFOV-US measurements were consistently different 
      (p < 0.05) than prior cadaveric data, highlighting the need to better understand 
      differences between in vivo and ex vivo fascicle length measurements. Fascicle 
      length was significantly related to only hand length (r(2) = 0.56, p = 0.03) for 
      APB, highlighting that anthropometric scaling may not accurately estimate thumb 
      muscle length. As the first study to apply EFOV-US to measure thumb muscle 
      fascicle lengths, this study expands the utility of this imaging technology 
      within the upper limb.

AB  - Vulnerable plaques associated with softer components may rupture, releasing 
      thrombotic emboli to smaller vessels in the brain, thus causing an ischemic 
      stroke. Pulse Wave Imaging (PWI) is an ultrasound-based method that allows for 
      pulse wave visualization while the regional pulse wave velocity (PWV) is mapped 
      along the arterial wall to infer the underlying wall compliance. One potential 
      application of PWI is the non-invasive estimation of plaque's mechanical 
      properties for investigating its vulnerability. In this study, the accuracy of 
      PWV estimation in stenotic vessels was investigated by computational simulation 
      and PWI in validation phantoms to evaluate this modality for assessing future 
      stroke risk. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) phantoms with plaque constituents of 
      different stiffnesses were designed and constructed to emulate stenotic arteries 
      in the experiment, and the novel fabrication process was described. 
      Finite-element fluid-structure interaction simulations were performed in a 
      stenotic phantom model that matched the geometry and parameters of the experiment 
      in phantoms. The peak distension acceleration of the phantom wall was tracked to 
      estimate PWV. PWVs of 2.57 ms(-1), 3.41 ms(-1), and 4.48 ms(-1) were respectively 
      obtained in the soft, intermediate, and stiff plaque material in phantoms during 
      the experiment using PWI. PWVs of 2.10 ms(-1), 3.33 ms(-1), and 4.02 ms(-1) were 
      respectively found in the soft, intermediate, and stiff plaque material in the 
      computational simulation. These results demonstrate that PWI can effectively 
      distinguish the mechanical properties of plaque in phantoms as compared to 
      computational simulation.

AB  - Electromechanical delay (EMD) and maximum isometric muscle force (F(o)(M)) are 
      important parameters for joint contact force calculation with EMG-informed 
      neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models. These parameters can vary between tasks (EMD) 
      and individuals (EMD and F(o)(M)), making it challenging to establish 
      representative values. One promising approach is to personalise candidate 
      parameters to the participant (e.g., F(o)(M) by regression equation) and then 
      adjust all parameters within a calibration (i.e., numerical optimisation) to 
      minimise error between corresponding pairs of experimental measures and 
      model-predicted values. The purpose of this study was to determine whether 
      calibration of an NMS model resulted in consistent joint contact forces, 
      regardless of EMD value or personalisation of F(o)(M). Hip, knee, and ankle 
      contact forces were predicted for 28 participants using EMG-informed NMS models. 
      Differences in joint contact forces with EMD were examined in six models, 
      calibrated with EMD from 15 to 110 ms. Differences in joint contact forces with 
      personalisation of F(o)(M) were examined in two models, both calibrated with the 
      same initial EMD (50 ms), one with generic and one with personalised values for 
      F(o)(M). For all models, joint contact force peaks during the first and second 
      halves of stance were extracted and compared using a repeated-measures analysis 
      of variance. Calibrated models with EMD set between 35 and 70 ms produced similar 
      magnitude and timing of peak joint contact forces. Compared with generic values, 
      personalising and then calibrating F(o)(M) resulted in comparable peak contact 
      forces at hip, but not knee or ankle, while also producing muscle-specific 
      tensions similar to reported literature. Overall, EMD between 35 and 70 ms and 
      personalised initial values of F(o)(M) before calibration are advised for 
      EMG-informed NMS modelling.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to assess the expression of caspase-8 and 
      procaspase-3 proteins in gastric cancer (GC) cells and non-cancerous mucosa in 
      relation to clinical and morphological characteristics of the tumor, 
      postoperative survival as well as other apoptosis-related proteins. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The study included 91 ​GC patients. Expression of the proteins was 
      assessed using immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: Positive expression of 
      procaspase-3 was found in all GC cells. A significant difference was found 
      between high expression of this protein in cancer cells (70.3%) and non-cancerous 
      mucosa (1.25%) (p ​≤ ​0.05). Caspase-8 expression was observed in 50.7% of GC 
      cells and 46.7% of mucosa. Caspase-8 was more common in Lauren type II compared 
      to Lauren type I cancer (p ​= ​0.009), while a statistically significant 
      difference was reported between positive procaspase-3 expression and 
      differentiation of GC (p ​= ​0.043) and Lauren's classification (p ​= ​0.028). We 
      observed a significant positive correlation between the expression of caspase-8 
      and bcl-xl (p ​= ​0.030) as well as between the procaspase-3 and BID 
      (p ​= ​0.026). Positive caspase-8 expression was associated with longer survival 
      of GC patients (p ​≤ ​0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the potential 
      role of the analyzed proteins in GC pathogenesis. Positive expression of 
      caspase-8 is associated with longer survival and better patient prognosis.

AB  - Endometrial stromal tumors (EST) are uterine mesenchymal tumors, which 
      histologically resemble endometrial stroma of the functioning endometrium. The 
      majority of EST are malignant tumors classified as low-grade endometrial stromal 
      sarcoma (LG-ESS), high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HG-ESS), and 
      undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (UUS). Overall, ESTs are rare malignancies, with 
      an annual incidence of approximately 0.30 per 100'000 women, mainly affecting 
      peri- or postmenopausal women. The most common genetic alteration identified in 
      LG-ESS is the JAZF1-SUZ12 rearrangement, while t(10;17)(q23,p13) translocation 
      and BCOR gene abnormalities characterize two major subtypes of HG-ESS. The 
      absence of specific genetic abnormalities is the actual hallmark of UUS. Unlike 
      HG-ESSs, LG-ESSs usually express estrogen and progesterone receptors. Total 
      hysterectomy without morcellation and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is 
      the first-line treatment of early-stage LG-ESS. Ovarian preservation, 
      fertility-sparing treatment, and adjuvant hormonal therapy ± radiotherapy may be 
      an option in selected cases. In advanced or recurrent LG-ESS, surgical 
      cytoreduction followed by hormonal treatment, or vice versa, are acceptable 
      treatments. The standard treatment for apparently early-stage HG-ESS and UUS is 
      total hysterectomy without morcellation with BSO. Ovarian preservation and 
      adjuvant chemotherapy ± radiotherapy may be an option. In advanced or recurrent 
      HG-ESS, surgical cytoreduction and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy can be 
      considered. Alternative treatments, including biological agents and 
      immunotherapy, are under investigation. LG-ESSs are indolent tumor with a 5-year 
      overall survival (OS) of 80-100% and present as stage I-II at diagnosis in two 
      third of patients. HG-ESSs carry a poor prognosis, with a median OS ranging from 
      11 to 24 months, and 70% of patients are in stage III-IV at presentation. UUS 
      median OS ranges from 12 to 23 months and, at diagnosis, 70% of patients are in 
      stage III-IV. The aim of this review is to assess the clinical, pathological, and 
      biological features and the therapeutic options for malignant ESTs.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant cancer type with a high mortality rate. 
      As no obvious symptoms are associated with this cancer type, most of the 
      diagnoses are made when the patients are already in a late stage. In this work, 
      we propose an automated method for effective early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer 
      based on multiple instance learning with contrast-enhanced CT images. In this 
      method, diagnosis stability and generalizability were improved through shape 
      normalization based on anatomical structures as well as instance-level 
      contrastive learning. Specifically, anatomically-guided shape normalization were 
      developed to reconstruct the pancreatic regions of interest by spatial 
      transformations, account for larger tumor parts in these regions, and hence 
      enhance the extraction of pancreatic features. Moreover, instance-level 
      contrastive learning was employed to aggregate different types of tumor features 
      within the multiple instance learning framework. This learning approach can 
      maintain the tumor feature integrity and enhance the diagnosis stability. 
      Finally, a balance-adjustment strategy was designed to alleviate the class 
      imbalance problem caused by the scarcity of tumor samples. Extensive experimental 
      results demonstrated remarkable performance of our method when conducted 
      cross-validation on an in-house dataset with 310 patients and independent test on 
      two unseen datasets (a private test set with 316 and a publicly-available test 
      set with 281). The proposed strategies also led to significant improvements in 
      generalizability. Besides, the clinical significance of the proposed method was 
      further verified through two independent test results in which tumors smaller 
      than 2 cm in diameter were identified at accuracies of 80.9% and 90.1%, 
      respectively. Overall, our method provides a potentially successful tool for 
      early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Our source codes will be released at

AB  - BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a systemic form of endemic mycosis to the American 
      continent and may be lethal to people living with HIV/AIDS. The drugs available 
      for treating histoplasmosis are limited, costly, and highly toxic. New drug 
      development is time-consuming and costly; hence, drug repositioning is an 
      advantageous strategy for discovering new therapeutic options. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study was conducted to identify drugs that can be repositioned for treating 
      histoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: Homologous proteins among 
      Histoplasma capsulatum strains were selected and used to search for homologous 
      targets in the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database. Essential genes were 
      selected using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, and functional regions of the 
      therapeutic targets were analyzed. The antifungal activity of the selected drugs 
      was verified, and homology modeling and molecular docking were performed to 
      verify the interactions between the drugs with low inhibitory concentration 
      values and their corresponding targets. RESULTS: We selected 149 approved drugs 
      with potential activity against histoplasmosis, among which eight were selected 
      for evaluating their in vitro activity. For drugs with low minimum inhibitory 
      concentration values, such as mebendazole, everolimus, butenafine, and 
      bifonazole, molecular docking studies were performed. A chemogenomic framework 
      revealed lanosterol 14-α-demethylase, squalene monooxygenase, 
      serine/threonine-protein kinase mTOR, and the β-4B tubulin chain of H. 
      capsulatum, respectively, as the protein targets of the drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      strategy can be used to identify promising antifungal targets, and drugs with 
      repositioning potential for treating H. capsulatum.

AB  - Acylsugars constitute a diverse class of secondary metabolites found in many 
      flowering plant families. Comprising sugar cores and acyl groups connected by 
      ester and/or ether linkages, acylsugar structures vary considerably at all 
      taxonomic levels - from populations of the same species to across species of the 
      same family and across flowering plants, with some species producing hundreds of 
      acylsugars in a single organ. Acylsugars have been most well-studied in the 
      Solanaceae family, but structurally analogous compounds have also been reported 
      in the Convolvulaceae, Martyniaceae, Geraniaceae, Rubiaceae, Rosaceae and 
      Caryophyllaceae families. Focusing on Solanaceae and Convolvulaceae acylsugars, 
      this review highlights their structural diversity, the potential biosynthetic 
      mechanisms that produce this diversity, and its functional significance. Finally, 
      we also discuss the possibility that some of this diversity is merely "noise", 
      arising out of enzyme promiscuity and/or non-adaptive evolutionary mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) is highly responsive to 
      immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs); however, durability of response after 
      treatment cessation and response to retreatment in the setting of progression is 
      unknown. METHODS: Patients (pts) having mMCC from 10 centres who discontinued ICI 
      treatment for a reason other than progression were studied. RESULTS: Forty 
      patients were included. Median time on treatment was 13.5 months (range 1-35). 
      Thirty-one patients (77.5%) stopped treatment electively while 9 patients (22.5%) 
      stopped due to treatment-related toxicity. After median of 12.3 months from 
      discontinuation, 14 pts (35%) have progressed (PD). Disease progression rate 
      following ICI discontinuation was 26% (8 of 31) in patients who discontinued in 
      complete response (CR), 57% (4 of 7) in patients in partial response and 100% (2 
      of 2) in those with stable disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) after 
      treatment cessation was 21 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 18- not reached 
      [NR]), with a third of patients progressing during their first year off 
      treatment. PFS was longer for patients who discontinued ICI electively (median 
      PFS 29 months; 95% CI, 21-NR) compared to those who stopped due to toxicity 
      (median PFS 11 months; 95% CI, 10-NR). ICI was restarted in 8 of 14 pts (57%) 
      with PD, with response rate of 75% (4 CR, 2 partial response, 1 stable disease, 1 
      PD). CONCLUSION: ICI responses in mMCC do not appear durable off treatment, 
      including in patients who achieve a CR, though response to retreatment is 
      promising. Extended duration of treatment needs to be investigated to optimise 
      long-term outcomes.

AB  - The scintillator detectors such as LaCl(3)(Ce) play an important role in some 
      fields of scientific research, environment, safeguards, medicine, security and 
      industry due to its superior energy resolution and exceptional luminescence 
      properties, etc. However, Cl element in a LaCl(3) crystal produces uncertainty of 
      determining oil saturation in pulsed neutron logging because of the background 
      spectrum caused by secondary gamma ray from the reaction of Cl nuclei with the 
      neutron. In this paper, we employed Monte Carlo method to simulate secondary 
      gamma ray generated LaCl(3) crystal induced by thermal neutron with different 
      borehole and formation conditions and establish a reference spectrum of Cl 
      element. The relations between elemental window or peak areas counts and borehole 
      and formation conditions were also investigated. The background was obtained by 
      combining the reaction rate derived from thermal neutron capture cross section 
      for Cl element and neutron flux with the reference spectrum. The results indicate 
      that the contribution of secondary gamma ray to measuring spectrum decreases with 
      formation porosity, limestone content, borehole diameter, and water salinity 
      increasing. Nevertheless, the relative peak areas of Cl at different energies 
      remain constant, indicating that the logging conditions have less of an effect on 
      the background spectrum shape. As evidenced by the measured spectra in the 
      sandstone and limestone calibration wells processed, the peaks of Si and Ca 
      elements are enhanced while the peaks of Cl element are weakened. After 
      subtracting detector background, the computations of oil saturation based on 
      calibration wells are 38% more accurate than the original method.

AB  - Structure-based drug design uses three-dimensional geometric information of 
      macromolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, to identify suitable ligands. 
      Geometric deep learning, an emerging concept of neural-network-based machine 
      learning, has been applied to macromolecular structures. This review provides an 
      overview of the recent applications of geometric deep learning in bioorganic and 
      medicinal chemistry, highlighting its potential for structure-based drug 
      discovery and design. Emphasis is placed on molecular property prediction, ligand 
      binding site and pose prediction, and structure-based de novo molecular design. 
      The current challenges and opportunities are highlighted, and a forecast of the 
      future of geometric deep learning for drug discovery is presented.

AB  - Although promising for biomedicine, the clinical translation of inorganic 
      nanoparticles (NPs) is limited by low biocompatibility and stability in 
      biological fluids. A common strategy to circumvent this drawback consists in 
      disguising the active inorganic core with a lipid bilayer coating, reminiscent of 
      the structure of the cell membrane to redefine the chemical and biological 
      identity of NPs. While recent reports introduced membrane-coating procedures for 
      NPs, a robust and accessible method to quantify the integrity of the bilayer 
      coverage is not yet available. To fill this gap, we prepared SiO(2) nanoparticles 
      (SiO(2)NPs) with different membrane coverage degrees and monitored their 
      interaction with AuNPs by combining microscopic, scattering, and optical 
      techniques. The membrane-coating on SiO(2)NPs induces spontaneous clustering of 
      AuNPs, whose extent depends on the coating integrity. Remarkably, we discovered a 
      linear correlation between the membrane coverage and a spectral descriptor for 
      the AuNPs' plasmonic resonance, spanning a wide range of coating yields. These 
      results provide a fast and cost-effective assay to monitor the compatibilization 
      of NPs with biological environments, essential for bench tests and scale-up. In 
      addition, we introduce a robust and scalable method to prepare SiO(2)NPs/AuNPs 
      hybrids through spontaneous self-assembly, with a high-fidelity structural 
      control mediated by a lipid bilayer.

AB  - Since adhesive membrane fouling is critically determined by the interfacial 
      interaction between a foulant and a rough membrane surface, efficient 
      quantification of the interfacial interaction is critically important for 
      adhesive membrane fouling mitigation. As a current available method, the advanced 
      extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory involves complicated 
      rigorous thermodynamic equations and massive amounts of computation, restricting 
      its application. To solve this problem, artificial intelligence (AI) 
      visualization technology was used to analyze the existing literature, and the 
      genetic algorithm back propagation (GABP) artificial neural network (ANN) was 
      employed to simplify thermodynamic calculation. The results showed that GABP ANN 
      with 5 neurons could obtain reliable prediction performance in seconds, versus 
      several hours or even days time-consuming by the advanced XDLVO theory. Moreover, 
      the regression coefficient (R) of GABP reached 0.9999, and the error between the 
      prediction results and the simulation results was less than 0.01%, indicating 
      feasibility of the GABP ANN technique for quantification of interfacial 
      interaction related with adhesive membrane fouling. This work provided a novel 
      strategy to efficiently optimize the thermodynamic prediction of adhesive 
      membrane fouling, beneficial for better understanding and control of adhesive 
      membrane fouling.

AB  - Persulfate (PS) activated by thermal or homogeneous metals can generate reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS) and high-valence-state metals for contaminants degradation, 
      showing great potential for applications. However, thermal effect in 
      peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system with high-valence-state metal is still ambiguous. 
      In this study, divalent copper (Cu(II)) catalysis was taken to explore thermal 
      effect on PMS performance. Results showed that the Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal 
      efficiency in the Cu(II)/PMS system at 60 min increased by only 5.9% with 
      temperature increase from 30 °C to 60 °C. Moreover, SMX removal efficiency was 
      excellent at neutral or basic pH, best with PMS concentration of 2.4 mM, and 
      slightly affected by Cu(II) concentration. The singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) was 
      identified as main active species at low temperature while sulfate radicals 
      (SO(4)(-)) was more effective at high temperature with Cu(II) co-activation. 
      Also, trivalent copper (Cu(III)) was an important active species. The higher 
      Cu(III) content, the better SMX removal efficiency, but the stronger 
      intermediates toxicity. In combination with removal efficiency and intermediates 
      toxicity at different temperatures, 30 °C was the optimal reaction temperature. 
      Overall, this study provides new perspective on utilization of waste heat and 
      high-valence-state metal for organic wastewater treatment in PMS systems.

AB  - Developing highly efficient and stable photocatalysts remains a major challenge 
      for the remediation of environmental pollutants. In this work, the Bi(0) 
      decorated BiOI-Bi(2)O(3)/C(3)N(4) heterojunction (Bi@BiOI-Bi(2)O(3)/C(3)N(4)) 
      film was fabricated through ultrasonic stripping, I(-) etching and in situ 
      UV-reduction processes and then characterized thoroughly by various analytical 
      techniques. The characteristics of simultaneous mitigation of phenol and Cr(VI) 
      were evaluated over Bi@BiOI-Bi(2)O(3)/C(3)N(4) photoanode under visible light. 
      The results exhibited that both phenol and Cr(VI) were removed completely by the 
      photoanode at 2.5 V within 1.5 h, superior to our previous report. The synergy of 
      the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Bi(0) and ternary heterojunction 
      accelerated the separation and transfer of photo-induced charge carrier and thus 
      heavily promoted the removal efficiency. Moreover, the excellent stability of 
      this photoanode was hold with no considerably activity attenuation after 4 
      cycles. Finally, a dual Z-scheme charge transfer process was presented. This work 
      offers an attractive pathway to construct highly active photoelectrode with 
      promising application for simultaneous remediation of organics and heavy metals 
      in wastewater.

AB  - Light-controlled therapies offer a promising strategy to prevent and suppress 
      infections caused by numerous bacterial pathogens. Excitation of exogenously 
      supplied photosensitizers (PS) at specific wavelengths elicits levels of reactive 
      oxygen intermediates toxic to bacteria. Porphyrin-based supramolecular 
      nanostructure frameworks (SNF) are effective PS with unique physicochemical 
      properties that have led to their widespread use in photomedicine. Herein, we 
      developed a nitric oxide (NO) releasing, biocompatible, and stable 
      porphyrin-based SNF (SNF-NO), which was achieved through a confined noncovalent 
      self-assembly process based on π-π stacking. Characterization of the SNFs via 
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 
      analysis showed the formation of three-dimensional, well-defined octahedral 
      structures. These SNF-NO were shown to exhibit a red shift due to the noncovalent 
      self-assembly of porphyrins, which also show extended light absorption to broadly 
      cover the entire visible light spectrum to enhance photodynamic therapy (PDT). 
      Under visible light irradiation (46 J cm(-2)), the SNF generates high yields of 
      singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) radicals, hydroxyl radicals (HO), superoxide radicals 
      (O(2)), and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) radicals that have shown potential to enhance 
      antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) against Gram-positive 
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative Escherichia 
      coli (E. coli). The resulting SNFs also exhibit significant biofilm dispersion 
      and a decrease in biomass production. The combination of robust photosensitizer 
      SNFs with nitric oxide-releasing capabilities is dynamic in its ability to target 
      pathogenic infections while remaining nontoxic to mammalian cells. The engineered 
      SNFs have enormous potential for treating and managing microbial infections.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Homogeneous dispersion of graphene is the precondition for 
      constructing high performance graphene based composites. However, most of the 
      current dispersants reported in literature still suffer excess usage to reach a 
      desired graphene concentration. Residual of dispersant in composite may seriously 
      affect its properties. Hence, it is expected to obtain effective dispersant with 
      high reactivity to diminish its adverse impacts on graphene composites. 
      EXPERIMENTS: A highly reactive graphene dispersant (DSiA) was synthesized by 
      grafting silanol groups (Si-OH) onto adenine. Molecular structure and the 
      performance of the dispersant were systematically characterized. Composites were 
      fabricated by direct writing of the graphene dispersion on various substrates, 
      and their features were evaluated by resistance, solvent erosion and tensile 
      testing. FINDINGS: Graphene concentration can reach up to 6 mg mL(-1) in the 
      presents of DSiA at the weight ratio of 1:1 (DSiA: graphene). DSiA also exhibited 
      good performance for stabilizing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). 
      Moreover, the dispersant is highly reactive. The graphene based composites showed 
      good mechanical strength and excellent solvent resistance. Overall, the new 
      dispersant provides an ideal choice to uniformly disperse graphene and suitable 
      for fabricating high performance nanocarbon based composites.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parotidectomies have historically been performed on an inpatient 
      basis despite being well-tolerated surgeries with minimal postoperative wound 
      care and low rates of complications at high-volume institutions. Past studies 
      have supported the safety of outpatient surgery for parotidectomy but have been 
      limited to superficial parotidectomy and have not addressed the patient 
      experience surrounding the surgical intervention such as pre-operative and 
      post-operative care and communication. PURPOSE: This study assesses the impact of 
      outpatient superficial, deep, and partial parotid surgery on various parameters 
      including surgical safety, distance traveled for care, utilization of telehealth, 
      and patient-initiated communication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study 
      from January 2020 to October 2021. Patients undergoing superficial lobe, deep 
      lobe, and partial parotidectomies for benign and malignant pathologies were 
      divided into inpatient and outpatient cohorts. A multivariable model examined the 
      relationship between admission status and surgical complications, adjusted for 
      age, sex, and tumor size. RESULTS: 159 patients total, 94 outpatient and 65 
      inpatients. No statistical difference in rates of surgical complications with the 
      exception of salivary leak. There was an increased rate of salivary leak reported 
      in the inpatient group (OR 5.4, 95 % CI 1.6 to 18.0, p = 0.01). Mean patient 
      travel distance of 354 miles one-way. Post-operatively, 76 % were evaluated via 
      video visit. Following discharge, >55 % of patients initiated communication with 
      the surgical team, which was not statistically different between the groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient parotidectomy is safe and can be more convenient, but 
      telehealth communication must be balanced with rigorous attention to patient 
      education.

AB  - Body image concerns are associated with disordered eating, body dysmorphic 
      disorder (BDD), and illicit appearance and performance enhancing drug (APED) 
      misuse. Sexual minority individuals are a vulnerable population for body image 
      concerns. Latent profile analyses were used to identify body image patterns in 
      sexual minority men (n = 479) and women (n = 483) and to investigate associations 
      between latent profiles and body image-related pathology. A 5-profile solution 
      demonstrated best fit for men and a 4-profile solution for women. Among women, 
      co-occurring high thinness/muscularity concerns had higher probability of 
      vomiting and dietary restriction than the high thinness/low muscularity concerns 
      profile. The probability of driven exercise did not differ across latent profiles 
      for men and only differed between low thinness/low muscularity and high 
      thinness/high muscularity concerns profiles in women. Men with low thinness/high 
      muscularity concerns had significantly lower probability of vomiting and laxative 
      misuse than all other profiles but did not significantly differ from co-occurring 
      high or moderate thinness/muscularity concerns profiles in binge eating and 
      illicit APED misuse. This study may have implications for future research, 
      treatment, and prevention of body image-related pathology in sexual minority 
      individuals.

TI  - Longitudinal association of homonegative school climate with body dysmorphic 
      disorder among cisgender sexual minority adolescents: Testing mediation through 
      proximal minority stressors.

AB  - In a US national cohort study of cisgender sexual minority adolescents (SMAs), we 
      prospectively (1) assessed whether within-person changes in homonegative school 
      climate (i.e., school contextual factors that lead SMAs to feel unsafe or 
      threatened) were associated with risk of probable body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) 
      and (2) tested whether internalized homonegativity and negative expectancies 
      mediated this association. Data came from consecutive time points (18-month, 
      24-month, 30-month) of the Adolescent Stress Experiences over Time Study (ASETS; 
      N = 758). The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire measured probable BDD. 
      Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory subscales measured past 30-day 
      minority stress experiences. Multilevel models were specified with person 
      mean-centered predictor variables to capture within-person effects. Across one 
      year of follow-up, 26.86% screened positive for probable BDD at least once. Model 
      results indicated significant total (risk ratio [RR]=1.43, 95% credible interval 
      [CI]=1.35-1.52) and direct effects (RR=1.18, 95% CI=1.05-1.34) of homonegative 
      school climate. Internalized homonegativity was independently associated with 
      probable BDD (RR=1.28, 95% CI=1.12-1.46) and mediated 49.7% (95% CI=12.4-82.0) of 
      the total effect. There was limited evidence of mediation via negative 
      expectancies. Implementing SMA-protective school policies and targeting 
      internalized homonegativity in clinical practice may reduce the prevalence and 
      incidence of probable BDD among cisgender SMAs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Osteosarcoma is typically a disease of the young, but may affect 
      any age. Little is known about the disease in older patients beyond retirement 
      age. We aim to describe the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of older 
      adult patients registered with our cooperative group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      database of the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group (COSS) was searched for 
      osteosarcoma patients diagnosed from 1980 to 2020 who were aged 65 years or older 
      at diagnosis. Affected individuals were analyzed for presenting factors, 
      treatments employed, and outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-five eligible patients were 
      detected (median age 68 [range: 65-84] years; male:female = 25:30). Among these 
      patients, 15/55 (27%) tumors were secondary malignancies, 41/55 (75%) were 
      high-grade central, 4/55 (7%) surface, and 10/55 (18%) extraosseous malignancies, 
      and all but three high-grade. Primary metastases were present in 15/55 (27%) 
      patients. Surgery was reported for 46/55 (84%) patients, radiotherapy for 6/54 
      (11%, 1 unknown), chemotherapy for 42/50 (84%, 5 unknown). A complete surgical 
      remission was achieved in 31/55 (56%). There were two toxic deaths. With a median 
      follow-up of 1.7 (range: 0.1-18.0) years for all 55 patients and 2.2 (0.1-12.4) 
      years for 24 survivors, event-free and overall survival at 2/5 years were 39.6% 
      (standard error: 6.8%) / 24.5% (6.5%) and 62.0% (7.1%) / 32.7% (7.5%), 
      respectively. Tumor site, metastatic status, surgery, and a complete surgical 
      remission were prognostic for event-free and/or overall survival. DISCUSSION: 
      Osteosarcomas can occur in older individuals. It is more often secondary, axially 
      located, or extraosseous than in younger patients. However, the same treatment 
      principles seem to apply, and selected patients may be cured. Multi-center 
      cooperation is encouraged, thereby gathering expertise for such a rare disease 
      presentation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies globally 
      and it can both be difficult to diagnose but also to differentiate complicated 
      from uncomplicated appendicitis preoperatively. The objective of this scoping 
      review was to develop an overview of biomarkers in blood discriminating 
      complicated from uncomplicated appendicitis and characterize their applicability 
      in an acute setting including time, cost, and analysis technique required as well 
      as their individual precision. METHOD: This scoping review was reported in 
      accordance with PRISMA-ScR. The included studies had to report on biomarkers 
      measured in the blood for at least ten patients with suspected appendicitis. A 
      systematic literature search was conducted on August 28, 2022, in PubMed and 
      Embase but restricted to articles published in January 2000 and onwards. A 
      protocol was uploaded to Open Science Framework prior to data extraction. 
      RESULTS: A total of 65 biomarkers were included from 52 studies, covering 14,312 
      patients. There was 60% routine- and 40% novel biomarkers based on the reported 
      analysis technique. The most frequently investigated biomarkers within each group 
      were white blood cell count and procalcitonin. The routine biomarkers were of low 
      financial cost but poor diagnostic accuracy with sensitivity ranging between 15 
      and 100% and specificity between 27 and 100%. Novel markers were costly ranging 
      from 275 to 800$, and their diagnostic accuracy was based on limited population 
      sizes (median 34 patients) and reported for only 5% of the novel markers. 
      CONCLUSION: Routine biomarkers were applicable in an acute setting but had poor 
      diagnostic accuracy. Novel biomarkers are being investigated for potential, but 
      the concept is still premature due to lack of diagnostic accuracy studies 
      reporting cost-benefit for individual markers and whether they can be applied in 
      an acute setting.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on care for 
      survivors of sexual assault in three urban Emergency Departments (ED) in the 
      United States. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients 
      who presented after sexual assault to three EDs during 6-month intervals before 
      and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We excluded individuals <18 years old. We 
      performed a structured chart review to ascertain demographics, ED treatments, and 
      adherence to guidelines for care of sexual assault survivors. RESULTS: Of 105 
      patients who received care after a sexual assault, 57 presented during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. The majority were female, White/Caucasian, and presented 
      within 120 h of sexual assault. There was an increase in ED presentations for 
      sexual assault during the pandemic. While there was no difference in medical 
      care, there were fewer sexual assault advocates called during the pandemic. In 
      addition, there was an increase in non-White survivors in the first 3 months of 
      the pandemic that did not remain at 6 months. CONCLUSION: The care of survivors 
      in the ED was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While medical care remained 
      similar, fewer calls to sexual assault advocates, a key component of ED and 
      long-term care of survivors, demonstrate a disruption in their care.

AB  - Predicting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-induced heating of elongated 
      conductive implants, such as leads in cardiovascular implantable electronic 
      devices, is essential to assessing patient safety. Phantom experiments have 
      traditionally been used to estimate radio-frequency (RF) heating of implants, but 
      they are time-consuming. Recently, machine learning has shown promise for fast 
      prediction of RF heating of orthopaedic implants when the implant position within 
      the MRI RF coil was predetermined. We explored whether deep learning could be 
      applied to predict RF heating of conductive leads with variable positions and 
      orientations during MRI at 1.5 T and 3 T. Models of 600 cardiac leads with 
      clinically relevant trajectories were generated, and electromagnetic simulations 
      were performed to calculate the maximum of the 1 g-averaged specific absorption 
      rate (SAR) of RF energy at the tips of lead models during MRI at 1.5 T and 3 T. 
      Neural networks were trained to predict the maximum SAR at the lead tip from the 
      knowledge of the coordinates of points along the lead trajectory. Despite the 
      large range of SAR values (∼230 W/kg to ∼ 3200 W/kg and ∼ 10 W/kg 
      to ∼ 3300 W/kg), the root- mean-square error of the predicted vs ground truth SAR 
      remained at 223 W/kg and 206 W/kg, with the R(2) scores of 0.89 and 0.85 on the 
      testing set for 1.5 T and 3 T models, respectively. The results suggest that 
      machine learning is a promising approach for fast assessment of RF heating of 
      lead-like implants when only the knowledge of the lead geometry and MRI RF coil 
      features are in hand.

AB  - In this work we demonstrate the use of microfluidic NMR for in situ culture and 
      quantitative analysis of metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. 
      A hydrothermal heating system is used to enable continuous in situ NMR 
      observation of HCC cell culture over a 24 h incubation period. This technique is 
      nondestructive, non-invasive and can measure millimolar concentrations at 
      microlitre volumes, within a few minutes and in precisely controlled culture 
      conditions. This is sufficient to observe changes in primary energy metabolism, 
      using around 500-3500 cells per device, and with a time resolution of 17 min. The 
      ability to observe intracellular responses in a time-resolved manner provides a 
      more detailed view of a biological system and how it reacts to stimuli. This 
      capability will allow detailed metabolomic studies of cell-culture based cancer 
      models, enabling quantification of metabolic reporgramming, the metabolic tumor 
      microenvironment, and the metabolic interplay between cancer- and immune cells.

AB  - Dietary components and metabolites have a profound impact on immunity and 
      inflammation. Here, we investigated how sensing of cholesterol metabolite 
      oxysterols by γδ T cells impacts their tissue residency and function. We show 
      that dermal IL-17-producing γδ T (Tγδ17) cells essential for skin-barrier 
      homeostasis require oxysterols sensing through G protein receptor 183 (GPR183) 
      for their development and inflammatory responses. Single-cell transcriptomics and 
      murine reporter strains revealed that GPR183 on developing γδ thymocytes is 
      needed for their maturation by sensing medullary thymic epithelial-cell-derived 
      oxysterols. In the skin, basal keratinocytes expressing the oxysterol enzyme 
      cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) maintain dermal Tγδ17 cells. Diet-driven 
      increases in oxysterols exacerbate Tγδ17-cell-mediated psoriatic inflammation, 
      dependent on GPR183 on γδ T cells. Hence, cholesterol-derived oxysterols control 
      spatially distinct but biologically linked processes of thymic education and 
      peripheral function of dermal T cells, implicating diet as a focal parameter of 
      dermal Tγδ17 cells.

      radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced recurrent nasopharyngeal

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reirradiation in standard fractionation for locally advanced 
      recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma after a previous course of high-dose 
      radiotherapy is often associated with substantial late toxicity, negating its 
      overall benefit. We therefore aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
      hyperfractionation compared with standard fractionation in intensity-modulated 
      radiotherapy. METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial 
      was done in three centres in Guangzhou, China. Eligible patients were aged 18-65 
      years with histopathologically confirmed undifferentiated or differentiated, 
      non-keratinising, advanced locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
      Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either receive hyperfractionation 
      (65 Gy in 54 fractions, given twice daily with an interfractional time interval 
      of at least 6 h) or standard fractionation (60 Gy in 27 fractions, given once a 
      day). Intensity-modulated radiotherapy was used in both groups. A computer 
      program generated the assignment sequence and randomisation was stratified by 
      treatment centre, recurrent tumour stage (T2-T3 vs T4), and recurrent nodal stage 
      (N0 vs N1-N2), determined at the time of randomisation. The two primary endpoints 
      were the incidence of severe late complications defined as the incidence of grade 
      3 or worse late radiation-induced complications occurring 3 months after the 
      completion of radiotherapy until the latest follow-up in the safety population, 
      and overall survival defined as the time interval from randomisation to death due 
      to any cause in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02456506. FINDINGS: Between July 10, 2015, and Dec 23, 
      2019, 178 patients were screened for eligibility, 144 of whom were enrolled and 
      randomly assigned to hyperfractionation or standard fractionation (n=72 in each 
      group). 35 (24%) participants were women and 109 (76%) were men. After a median 
      follow-up of 45·0 months (IQR 37·3-53·3), there was a significantly lower 
      incidence of grade 3 or worse late radiation-induced toxicity in the 
      hyperfractionation group (23 [34%] of 68 patients) versus the standard 
      fractionation group (39 [57%] of 68 patients; between-group difference -23% [95% 
      CI -39 to -7]; p=0·023). Patients in the hyperfractionation group had better 
      3-year overall survival than those in the standard fractionation group (74·6% 
      [95% CI 64·4 to 84·8] vs 55·0% [43·4 to 66·6]; hazard ratio for death 0·54 [95% 
      CI 0·33 to 0·88]; p=0·014). There were fewer grade 5 late complications in the 
      hyperfractionation group (five [7%] nasal haemorrhage) than in the standard 
      fractionation group (16 [24%], including two [3%] nasopharyngeal necrosis, 11 
      [16%] nasal haemorrhage, and three [4%] temporal lobe necrosis). INTERPRETATION: 
      Hyperfractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy could significantly decrease 
      the rate of severe late complications and improve overall survival among patients 
      with locally advanced recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Our findings suggest 
      that hyperfractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy could be used as the 
      standard of care for these patients. FUNDING: Key-Area Research and Development

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor has been shown to be safe and 
      efficacious in people with cystic fibrosis and at least one F508del allele. Our 
      aim was to identify a novel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
      (CFTR) modulator combination capable of further increasing CFTR-mediated chloride 
      transport, with the potential for once-daily dosing. METHODS: We conducted two 
      phase 2 clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of a once-daily 
      combination of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor in participants with cystic 
      fibrosis who were aged 18 years or older. A phase 2 randomised, double-blind, 
      active-controlled study (VX18-561-101; April 17, 2019, to Aug 20, 2020) was 
      carried out to compare deutivacaftor monotherapy with ivacaftor monotherapy in 
      participants with CFTR gating mutations, following a 4-week ivacaftor monotherapy 
      run-in period. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either ivacaftor 
      150 mg every 12 h, deutivacaftor 25 mg once daily, deutivacaftor 50 mg once 
      daily, deutivacaftor 150 mg once daily, or deutivacaftor 250 mg once daily in a 
      1:1:2:2:2 ratio. The primary endpoint was absolute change in ppFEV(1) from 
      baseline at week 12. A phase 2 randomised, double-blind, controlled, 
      proof-of-concept study of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (VX18-121-101; 
      April 30, 2019, to Dec 10, 2019) was conducted in participants with cystic 
      fibrosis and heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation (F/MF 
      genotypes) or homozygous for F508del (F/F genotype). Participants with F/MF 
      genotypes were randomly assigned 1:2:2:1 to receive either 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg 
      of vanzacaftor in combination with tezacaftor-deutivacaftor or a triple placebo 
      for 4 weeks, and participants with the F/F genotype were randomly assigned 2:1 to 
      receive either vanzacaftor (20 mg)-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor or 
      tezacaftor-ivacaftor active control for 4 weeks, following a 4-week 
      tezacaftor-ivacaftor run-in period. Primary endpoints for part 1 and part 2 were 
      safety and tolerability and absolute change in ppFEV(1) from baseline to day 29. 
      Secondary efficacy endpoints were absolute change from baseline at day 29 in 
      sweat chloride concentrations and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) 
      respiratory domain score. These clinical trials are registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03911713 and NCT03912233, and are complete. FINDINGS: In 
      study VX18-561-101, participants treated with deutivacaftor 150 mg once daily 
      (n=23) or deutivacaftor 250 mg once daily (n=24) had mean absolute changes in 
      ppFEV(1) of 3·1 percentage points (95% CI -0·8 to 7·0) and 2·7 percentage points 
      (-1·0 to 6·5) from baseline at week 12, respectively, versus -0·8 percentage 
      points (-6·2 to 4·7) with ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 h (n=11); the deutivacaftor 
      safety profile was consistent with the established safety profile of ivacaftor 
      150 mg every 12 h. In study VX18-121-101, participants with F/MF genotypes 
      treated with vanzacaftor (5 mg)-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=9), vanzacaftor (10 
      mg)-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=19), vanzacaftor (20 mg)-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor 
      (n=20), and placebo (n=10) had mean changes relative to baseline at day 29 in 
      ppFEV(1) of 4·6 percentage points (-1·3 to 10·6), 14·2 percentage points (10·0 to 
      18·4), 9·8 percentage points (5·7 to 13·8), and 1·9 percentage points (-4·1 to 
      8·0), respectively, in sweat chloride concentration of -42·8 mmol/L (-51·7 to 
      -34·0), -45·8 mmol/L (95% CI -51·9 to -39·7), -49·5 mmol/L (-55·9 to -43·1), and 
      2·3 mmol/L (-7·0 to 11·6), respectively, and in CFQ-R respiratory domain score of 
      17·6 points (3·5 to 31·6), 21·2 points (11·9 to 30·6), 29·8 points (21·0 to 
      38·7), and 3·3 points (-10·1 to 16·6), respectively. Participants with the F/F 
      genotype treated with vanzacaftor (20 mg)-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=18) and 
      tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=10) had mean changes relative to baseline (taking 
      tezacaftor-ivacaftor) at day 29 in ppFEV(1) of 15·9 percentage points (11·3 to 
      20·6) and -0·1 percentage points (-6·4 to 6·1), respectively, in sweat chloride 
      concentration of -45·5 mmol/L (-49·7 to -41·3) and -2·6 mmol/L (-8·2 to 3·1), 
      respectively, and in CFQ-R respiratory domain score of 19·4 points (95% CI 10·5 
      to 28·3) and -5·0 points (-16·9 to 7·0), respectively. The most common adverse 
      events overall were cough, increased sputum, and headache. One participant in the 
      vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group had a serious adverse event of 
      infective pulmonary exacerbation and another participant had a serious rash event 
      that led to treatment discontinuation. For most participants, adverse events were 
      mild or moderate in severity. INTERPRETATION: Once-daily dosing with 
      vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor was safe and well tolerated and improved 
      lung function, respiratory symptoms, and CFTR function. These results support the 
      continued investigation of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor in phase 3 
      clinical trials compared with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor. FUNDING: Vertex

TI  - Can an artificial intelligence chatbot be the author of a scholarly article?
PG  - 6
LID - 10.3352/jeehp.2022.20.6 [doi]
AB  - At the end of 2022, the appearance of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) 
      chatbot with amazing writing ability, caused a great sensation in academia. The 
      chatbot turned out to be very capable, but also capable of deception, and the 
      news broke that several researchers had listed the chatbot (including its earlier 
      version) as co-authors of their academic papers. In response, Nature and Science 
      expressed their position that this chatbot cannot be listed as an author in the 
      papers they publish. Since an AI chatbot is not a human being, in the current 
      legal system, the text automatically generated by an AI chatbot cannot be a 
      copyrighted work; thus, an AI chatbot cannot be an author of a copyrighted work. 
      Current AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are much more advanced than search engines in 
      that they produce original text, but they still remain at the level of a search 
      engine in that they cannot take responsibility for their writing. For this 
      reason, they also cannot be authors from the perspective of research ethics.

TI  - Important food sources of fructose-containing sugars and adiposity: A systematic 
      review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials.
LID - S0002-9165(23)04099-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ajcnut.2023.01.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) providing excess energy increase 
      adiposity. The effect of other food sources of sugars at different energy control 
      levels is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of food sources of 
      fructose-containing sugars by energy control on adiposity. METHODS: In this 
      systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library were 
      searched through April 2022 for controlled trials ≥2 wk. We prespecified 4 trial 
      designs by energy control: substitution (energy-matched replacement of sugars), 
      addition (energy from sugars added), subtraction (energy from sugars subtracted), 
      and ad libitum (energy from sugars freely replaced). Independent authors 
      extracted data. The primary outcome was body weight. Secondary outcomes included 
      other adiposity measures. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and 
      Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: We 
      included 169 trials (255 trial comparisons, n = 10,357) assessing 14 food sources 
      at 4 energy control levels over a median 12 wk. Total fructose-containing sugars 
      increased body weight (MD: 0.28 kg; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.50 kg; P(MD) = 0.011) in 
      addition trials and decreased body weight (MD: -0.96 kg; 95% CI: -1.78, -0.14 kg; 
      P(MD) = 0.022) in subtraction trials with no effect in substitution or ad libitum 
      trials. There was interaction/influence by food sources on body weight: 
      substitution trials [fruits decreased; added nutritive sweeteners and mixed 
      sources (with SSBs) increased]; addition trials [dried fruits, honey, fruits 
      (≤10%E), and 100% fruit juice (≤10%E) decreased; SSBs, fruit drink, and mixed 
      sources (with SSBs) increased]; subtraction trials [removal of mixed sources 
      (with SSBs) decreased]; and ad libitum trials [mixed sources (with/without SSBs) 
      increased]. GRADE scores were generally moderate. Results were similar across 
      secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Energy control and food sources mediate the 
      effect of fructose-containing sugars on adiposity. The evidence provides a good 
      indication that excess energy from sugars (particularly SSBs at high doses ≥20%E 
      or 100 g/d) increase adiposity, whereas their removal decrease adiposity. Most 
      other food sources had no effect, with some showing decreases (particularly 
      fruits at lower doses ≤10%E or 50 g/d). This trial was registered at 
      clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02558920 
      (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02558920).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To validate the hypothesis that apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 modifies 
      the effect of possible anticholinergic drugs (PACDs) on incident dementia among 
      older adults. DESIGN: A population-based prospective study. SETTING AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Dementia-free older adults in an urban community in Shanghai, 
      China. METHODS: At baseline, PACDs were defined according to the Anticholinergic 
      Cognitive Burden Scale. Standard daily dose (SDD) of PACDs was calculated. A 
      battery of neuropsychological tests was used to assess cognition and the 
      consensus diagnosis was conducted for incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). Multivariate Cox regression models were used to examine the association 
      between PACD use and the risk of dementia and AD in APOE ε4 carriers and 
      noncarriers. RESULTS: We followed 1406 dementia-free participants for a median of 
      5.3 years and defined 117 incident dementia cases, among which 89 were AD. Only 
      in APOE ε4 carriers was PACD use associated with incident dementia (hazard ratio 
      [HR] 5.71; 95% CI 2.04-15.94) and AD (HR 5.73; 95% CI 1.77-18.54); SDD was 
      positively associated with incident dementia (HR 2.42; 95% CI 1.32-4.44) and AD 
      (HR 2.16; 95% CI 1.06-4.41). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Using PACDs requires 
      judicious consideration for the potential risk of dementia and AD in older adults 
      carrying APOE ε4.

AB  - Lifestyle medicine practice can be enhanced with interpersonal communication 
      skills to help patients adopt and maintain positive health behaviors, such as 
      improving diet or initiating exercise. We review two approaches that incorporate 
      evidenced-based skills for this purpose: motivational interviewing and brief 
      action planning (BAP). Motivational interviewing involves four processes 
      conducted in a climate of acceptance, partnership, and empowerment. First, 
      "engaging" (or connecting) with patients uses "relational" skills of active 
      listening and empathic communication. Second, "focusing" elicits patients' full 
      spectrum of concerns, expectations, and desires to negotiate a collaborative 
      agenda. Third, "evoking motivation," utilizes uniquely innovative skills (e.g., 
      "softening sustain talk" and "cultivating change talk") to increase intrinsic 
      motivation of patients with ambivalence (or resistance) to become more open to 
      choosing healthier behaviors for themselves. Fourth, "planning for change," uses 
      collaborative goal-setting skills to help patients specify concrete action plans 
      for health. To this end, brief action planning (BAP) has been developed as a 
      specific pragmatic algorithmic approach, which utilizes "SMART" (specific, 
      measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based) goal planning, the 
      encouragement of patient commitment, scaling for confidence, problem-solving to 
      reduce barriers for change, and fostering patient accountability and follow-up. 
      BAP can be introduced at any point in a patient encounter when patients are ready 
      or nearly ready for change.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a severe neurodegenerative disease. Several environmental 
      contaminants such as pesticides have been suspected to favor the appearance of 
      this pathology. The protein DJ-1 (or Park7) protects against the development of 
      Parkinson's disease. Thus, the possible inhibitory effects of about a hundred 
      pesticides on human DJ-1 have been studied. We identified fifteen of them as 
      strong inhibitors of DJ-1 with IC50 values between 0.02 and 30 µM. Thiocarbamates 
      are particularly good inhibitors, as shown by thiram that acts as an irreversible 
      inhibitor of an esterase activity of DJ-1 with an IC50 value of 0.02 µM. Thiram 
      was also found as a good inhibitor of the protective activity of DJ-1 against 
      glycation. Such inhibitory effects could be one of the various biological effects 
      of these pesticides that may explain their involvement in the development of 
      Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Hypnosis is a clinically accepted relaxation technique known for stress 
      reduction. Results from hematological research provide evidence of changes in 
      blood components through hypnosis. However, these hematological effects have been 
      rarely examined. Hence, we exploratively investigated the effect of a single 
      relaxation hypnosis on the hemogram in stressed individuals, assuming a reduction 
      of leukocytes, thrombocytes, and erythrocytes (primary outcomes). Additionally, a 
      reduction in the erythrocyte-related parameters (hemoglobin, hematocrit), and an 
      increase in plasma volume was hypothesized (secondary outcomes). Forty-four 
      individuals (89% women) with chronic stress and moderate to high hypnotic 
      suggestibility were randomized to a hypnosis condition (20min relaxation 
      hypnosis; n = 20) or a control condition (20min documentary; n = 24). Venous 
      blood was drawn before and after the intervention and used to generate a 
      differential hemogram and determine the plasma volume. A relaxation hypnosis led 
      to a significant reduction in erythrocytes (Cohen´s d = 0.23) and consequently to 
      a decrease in erythrocyte-related parameters (hemoglobin, d = 0.27; hematocrit, d 
      = 0.37) as well as to a reduction in thrombocytes (d = 0.15) in the hypnosis 
      compared to the control condition. Putatively, this could be the consequence of 
      an increased plasma volume (d = 0.10), estimated by the hematocrit concentration 
      and body weight. A hypnosis-induced change in leukocyte count could not be 
      confirmed. Thus, a single session of relaxation hypnosis already alters specific 
      blood count parameters. While relaxation-induced vasodilatation might explain 
      these changes, it is still not completely clear how these changes affect our 
      stress response system.

AB  - The necessity to record and store biological data is increasing in due course of 
      time. However, it is quite difficult to understand biological mechanisms and keep 
      a track of these events in some storage mediums. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is 
      the best candidate for the storage of cellular events in the biological system. 
      It is energy efficient as well as stable at the same time. DNA-based writers and 
      memory devices are continually evolving and finding new avenues in terms of their 
      wide range of applications. Among all the DNA-based storage devices that employ 
      enzymes like recombinases, nucleases, integrases, and polymerases, one of the 
      most popular tools used for these devices is the emerging and versatile CRISPR 
      Cas technology. CRISPR Cas is a prokaryotic immune system that keeps a memory of 
      viral attacks and protects prokaryotes from potential future infections. The main 
      aim of this short review is to study such molecular recorders and writers that 
      employ CRISPR Cas technologies and obtain an in-depth overview of the mechanisms 
      involved and the applications of these molecular devices.

TI  - Activity of the old antimicrobial nitroxoline against Mycobacterium abscessus 
      complex isolates.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The old antimicrobial nitroxoline is approved to treat urinary tract 
      infection (UTI) and is currently rediscovered for treatment of drug resistant 
      pathogens. Mycobacteria of the Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MYABS) are 
      rapid-growing nontuberculous mycobacteria that are associated with difficult to 
      treat infections of the lungs in patients with pulmonary disorders such as cystic 
      fibrosis. In this study we assessed the in vitro activity of nitroxoline against 
      molecularly characterized drug resistant MYABS isolates from clinical samples to 
      address potential repurposing of nitroxoline in difficult to treat MYABS 
      infection. METHODS: The isolates originated from clinical samples collected 
      between 2010 and 2019 at the University Hospital of Cologne, Germany (N=16; 10/16 
      M. abscessus spp. abscessus, 4/16 M. abscessus spp. massiliense, 2/16 M. 
      abscessus spp. bolletii). Nitroxoline activity was compared to standard 
      antimicrobials recommended for treatment of MYABS infection. For drug 
      susceptibility testing of nitroxoline and comparators broth microdilution was 
      performed based on current CLSI guidelines. RESULTS: Nitroxoline yielded a 
      MIC(90) of 4 mg/L (range 2-4 mg/L), which is two twofold dilutions below the 
      current EUCAST susceptibility breakpoint of ≤ 16 mg/L (limited to uncomplicated 
      UTI and E. Coli). Resistance to other antimicrobials was common in our cohort 
      (16/16 isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin, imipenem and doxycycline; 12/16 
      isolates resistant to tobramycin; 9/16 isolates resistant to cefoxitin; 7/16 
      isolates resistant to clarithromycin; 2/16 isolates resistant to amikacin). 
      CONCLUSION: Nitroxoline has a promising in vitro-activity against drug resistant 
      MYABS isolates. Future studies should investigate this finding with macrophage 
      and in vivo models.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize the strains of 
      Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL-EC) isolated from 
      municipal and hospital wastewater by detecting antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) 
      as well as antibiotic susceptibility. To identify the source of ESBL-EC, 
      multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and typing plasmids that may carry 
      ESBL-producing genes were conducted. METHODS: Wastewater was sampled twice a 
      month from February 2019 to February 2020 from a municipal wastewater treatment 
      plant and hospital located in a city in northeastern Japan. Throughout the study 
      period, 279 and 37 strains of the ESBL-EC were isolated from municipal and 
      hospital wastewater, respectively. RESULTS: All 316 isolates were resistant to 
      ampicillin and cefotaxime and susceptible to imipenem and tigecycline. Almost all 
      (98.1%) of the ESBL-EC isolates possessed bla(CTX-M), and the bla(CTX-M-9) group 
      was detected most frequently (62.3%). MLST revealed a higher diversity of 
      sequence types (STs) in the isolates from municipal wastewater than in those from 
      hospital wastewater; although ST131, which recently caused nosocomial- and 
      community-associated infections worldwide, was dominant in both types of 
      wastewaters. All ST131 isolates possessed the IncFII plasmid, which is often 
      reported to carry bla(CTX-M). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that healthy 
      people carry clinically important antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and ARGs, 
      motivating routine monitoring of municipal wastewater to detect such ARB/ARGs 
      from a variety of sources supported by the high diversity of STs in the present 
      study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of fenestrated stent grafts to treat short neck, juxtarenal, 
      and suprarenal aortic aneurysms is increasing worldwide, but reports on mid-term 
      outcomes are scarce. This study aimed to report peri-operative results and 
      mid-term outcomes at five years from a single centre. METHODS: Patients treated 
      with primary FEVAR for short-neck, juxtarenal, or suprarenal aortic aneurysms 
      within the period January 2010 to May 2020 with follow up in the centre were 
      included. Early (technical success, operative mortality, spinal cord ischaemia) 
      and five year outcomes (cumulative survival, freedom from aortic related 
      mortality, target vessel patency, target vessel instability [TVI], 
      re-interventions) were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 349 patients (313 male, mean 
      age 72.3 ± 7.7 years) were included in the study. Technical success was 98% 
      (342/349). Thirty day mortality was 0.9% (3/349). Estimated survival at five 
      years was 69.3 ± 3.1%. Freedom from aneurysm related mortality at five years was 
      98.8% ± 0.7%. Estimated target vessel patency at five years was 98.7 ± 0.4%. 
      Estimated freedom from TVI at five years was 97.2 ± 0.6%. Estimated freedom from 
      re-intervention at five years was 86.5 ± 2.3%. Survival did not differ 
      significantly between patients with and without re-interventions (p= .088). 
      CONCLUSION: Mid-term results of FEVAR remain good as indicated by sustained 
      target vessel patency and low aortic related mortality rates. An important 
      proportion of patients require re-interventions, which do not have a negative 
      impact on mid-term survival.

TI  - Use of Intraoperative PRP During Rotator Cuff Repair is Correlated with Increased 
      Patient-Level Charges Across Multiple Categories.
LID - S1058-2746(23)00128-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2023.01.031 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To quantify whether augmenting arthroscopic RCR with PRP injections at 
      the time of surgery is correlated with increased patient-level charges. METHODS: 
      All outpatient records reported in Texas from 2010-2018 were obtained from the 
      publicly available Texas Healthcare Information Collection database through the 
      Texas Department of State Health Services. All records including a CPT code for 
      arthroscopic RCR were included. Of the 139,587 records identified within this 
      group, 1,662 also contained a CPT code for intraoperative PRP injection. 
      Patient-level charge data were compared between those who received and did not 
      receive concomitant PRP injection during the same outpatient surgical encounter. 
      Subgroup analyses were performed across surgical facilities, and insurance types. 
      Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare charges between PRP and non-PRP cases. 
      Linear regression was used to predict the change in billed charges according to 
      standard charge categories. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically 
      significant. RESULTS: The total charges for arthroscopic RCR over the 8-year 
      period was $4.66 billion, coming to $33,371 ± $22,118 per case. Cases that 
      included PRP injection were found to have significantly greater overall charges 
      than cases that did not ($54,452 ± $33,637 versus $33,117 ± $21,818; p<0.001). 
      Linear regression indicated that concomitant PRP injections predicted an increase 
      in combined total charges by $22,027 (95% CI, $20,425-$23,628; p<0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: PRP utilization at the time of rotator cuff surgery is correlated 
      with increased patient-level charges overall, which occur across all charge 
      subcategories, and persist across surgical facility, surgeon volume, and 
      insurance type. Detailed cost analysis is recommended to explore this charge 
      correlation, and future cost-benefit analyses of PRP use in RCR should explore 
      costs beyond that solely associated with PRP preparation, as these may have 
      previously been overlooked.

      frozen shoulder. However, to date no randomized controlled trial has directly 
      compared the efficacy of exercise and oral corticosteroids. The aim of this study 
      was to determine whether pain, range of motion, and function differ between 
      patients with frozen shoulder randomized to treatment with exercise or oral 
      corticosteroids. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, assessor-blinded trial 
      was performed to compare the effectiveness of exercise and oral corticosteroids 
      in patients with frozen shoulder. Overall, 33 patients with FS were randomly 
      assigned to receive either exercise (n=17) or oral corticosteroids (n = 16). The 
      exercise was applied 2 times per week for 6 weeks for 12 visits and patients in 
      oral corticosteroids group received prednisolone for 4 weeks. Participants were 
      assessed at baseline, after 6-weeks and at the 12-week follow-up. The primary 
      outcome was the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and visual 
      analog scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes were American Shoulder and Elbow 
      Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment (ASES), range of motion, and hospital 
      anxiety and depression (HAD). scale. Repeated-measures analysis of covariance 
      (ANCOVAs) with baseline scores as the covariates were used to determine 
      between-group differences. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed using the 
      multiple imputation method to impute values for all missing data. RESULTS: 
      Planned pairwise comparisons demonstrated significant improvements in pain relief 
      and functional outcomes in both groups at the 6- and 12-week follow-ups compared 
      to baseline. There were no significant time-by-group interactions between-group 
      differences noted for the DASH (F=0.470, p= 0.93), VAS (F=0.006, p=0.94), flexion 
      range of motion (ROM) (F=2.78, p=0.1), internal rotation ROM (F=3.440, p=0.07) 
      and ASES (F=0.470, p=0.49). The overall group-by-time interaction for the 2×3 
      mixed-model ANCOVA using baseline scores as a covariate was significant for the 
      abduction range (F=4.460, p=0.04) and external rotation range of motion 
      (F=12.100, p = 0.002) in favor of the exercise group CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      demonstrated that while both groups achieved significant improvements at the 6-, 
      and 12-week follow-ups, the exercise group was superior in terms of abduction and 
      external rotation range of motion. Additionally, even though both groups were 
      improved, the effect sizes were larger in the exercise group. Considering the 
      systemic side effects of oral corticosteroids, even at low doses, a well-planned 
      exercise program that considers pain may be a good option for frozen shoulder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Retear after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) remains a 
      complication of important concern. Few reports have evaluated retear timing and 
      its associated patient characteristics in large cohorts. This study aimed to 
      investigate retear timing and patient characteristics and factors associated with 
      this parameter. METHODS: Of the 638 consecutive shoulders that underwent ARCR 
      from August 2009 to November 2019, shoulders with retear complication within 1 
      year of surgery were included. Retears were defined as type IV or V of the 
      Sugaya's classification, and MRI was performed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 
      and 1 year after surgery. The distribution of patients with retears at the timing 
      of retears was investigated. In addition, patients with retears were classified 
      into the following two groups: early group with retears occurring at 6 weeks and 
      3 months postoperatively, or late group with retears occurring between 6 months 
      and 1 year postoperatively. Associated factors such as sex, age, tear size, pre- 
      and postoperative range of motion, surgical technique, and clinical outcome 
      between the two groups were investigated. RESULTS: The 41 shoulders with retears 
      were divided into four groups: 1) within 6 weeks after surgery (n=9, 22.0%), 2) 6 
      weeks to 3 months after surgery (n=19, 46.3%), 3) 3 to 6 months after surgery 
      (n=11, 26.8%), and 4) 6 months to 1 year after surgery (n=2, 4.9%). In addition, 
      there were significantly larger retear sizes in the Sugaya's classification in 
      the early group compared to the late group (p=0.013), while there were 
      significantly more males in the late group compared to the early group (p=0.030). 
      CONCLUSION: The highest retear rate after ARCR was observed from 6 weeks to 3 
      months after surgery, with equivalent rates within 6 weeks and from 3 months to 6 
      months after surgery.

TI  - Computed Tomography Provides Effective Detection of Traumatic Arthrotomy of the 
      Elbow.
LID - S1058-2746(23)00124-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2023.01.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Failure to identify a traumatic arthrotomy of the elbow (TAE) can 
      lead to septic arthritis with devastating complications. The gold standard for 
      TAE detection remains controversial, and evidence is limited. While multiple 
      clinical and cadaveric studies have validated the use of computed tomography (CT) 
      to detect traumatic arthrotomies about the knee, other studies have called into 
      question whether the use of CT to detect traumatic arthrotomy is applicable to 
      the elbow. A prior cadaveric study utilizing a direct posterior (transtendon) 
      traumatic arthrotomy model failed to detect traumatic arthrotomy via CT in 100% 
      of cases(11). The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity and 
      specificity for detecting TAE with CT, utilizing a lateral traumatic arthrotomy 
      model. METHODS: Ten fresh-frozen upper extremity transhumeral cadaveric specimens 
      were utilized. Only specimens with an intact elbow joint and no known elbow 
      surgery or injury were included. CT scans were performed to screen for 
      intra-articular air prior to arthrotomy. A full thickness 10 mm incision was 
      performed over the soft spot, just distal to the lateral epicondyle. The elbow 
      was taken through full range of motion in flexion and extension, as well as 
      forearm pronation and supination 10 times. CT scans were then repeated and 
      screened for the presence of intra-articular air. Lastly, a saline load test was 
      performed on all specimens, and the volume of saline required to detect the 
      arthrotomy was recorded. RESULTS: Of the 10 specimens, 0% (n=0) demonstrated 
      intra-articular air of the elbow joint on CT scan prior to arthrotomy, and 100% 
      (n=10) demonstrated intra-articular air on CT scan following arthrotomy. CT scan 
      demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for TAE. For the saline load 
      test, 90% (n=9) were positive for TAE at an average of 12 mL (range: 4mL-47mL), 
      providing 90% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: In this cadaveric study utilizing a more 
      commonly observed direct lateral traumatic laceration, CT was able to detect 100% 
      (n=10) of TAEs with 100% sensitivity and specificity. These results show that CT 
      scans can effectively diagnose lateral traumatic arthrotomy in a cadaveric model 
      and can be a viable option for diagnosis in a clinical setting. Clinical 
      correlation is required to confirm in these in vitro findings.

TI  - Factors Associated with Humeral Stem Revision in Anatomic to Reverse Total 
      Shoulder Arthroplasty Revision.
LID - S1058-2746(23)00127-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2023.01.030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent advances in implant technology have allowed for modular or 
      platform humeral stem insertion during initial anatomic total shoulder 
      arthroplasty (TSA). These systems allow for humeral stem retention during 
      conversion to reverse TSA (RTSA). However, some patients still require humeral 
      stem revision when undergoing revision to RTSA. The purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate the association between patient-specific factors and radiographic 
      parameters with humeral stem revision vs. retention during conversion from TSA to 
      RTSA. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted for patients who 
      underwent a revision anatomic to reverse total shoulder arthroplasty between 
      January 2010 and May 2022 at a single institution. Patients were included if 
      their prosthesis included a convertible humeral stem. Patient demographic 
      information, surgical details, and postoperative outcomes and complications were 
      collected. Radiographic parameters were measured by two graders on radiographs 
      taken prior to the revision procedure. The need for humeral stem revision and 
      ASES scores (preoperative and 2 years) were also noted. Statistical analysis was 
      performed using chi-square test for categorical variables and t-test for 
      continuous variables. RESULTS: 107 patients were included, 52 undergoing humeral 
      stem revision. Patients were revised an average of 51.0 ± 54 months after primary 
      TSA. Younger patient age (63.6 vs. 68.5 years, P = 0.017) and use of a 
      lateralized glenosphere (1.6mm vs. 0.4mm, P < 0.001) were significantly 
      associated with need for humeral stem revision. Glenoid to humeral head cut 
      distance (28.3mm vs 26.3mm, P = 0.076) approached significant association with 
      the need for humeral stem revision. All other measurements were not associated 
      with the need for humeral stem revision. Improvement of ASES scores at 2 years 
      follow-up was higher in the non-revised group (increase of 33.4 points) than the 
      revision group (23.3), but this did not reach significance (P = 0.149). Estimated 
      blood loss and surgical time were significantly higher in the stem revision group 
      than the non-revised group (P = 0.048 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: 
      Younger patients and those receiving a lateralized glenosphere were more likely 
      to undergo humeral stem revision during conversion from TSA to RTSA. Glenoid to 
      the humeral head cut distance should be studied further as a potential indication 
      for humeral stem revision, as it correlates with the space available for a 
      revision implant. This information can guide surgeons with preoperative planning 
      for a revision arthroplasty.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Most facets of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) have not 
      been thoroughly compared among minority populations, including Black patients. 
      Our study was designed to characterize the demographics, phenotypes, outcomes, 
      healthcare utilization, and treatment of IBD in a large cohort with 38% Black 
      patients. METHODS: Electronic health records of 3272 IBD patients seen in a 
      tertiary academic medical network from 2012 to July 15(th), 2019 were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Black patients with Crohn's disease were significantly more likely than 
      White patients to suffer from perianal (p < 0.001), fistulizing (p < 0.001), and 
      fibrostenotic phenotypes (p < 0.001). Black patients with IBD were significantly 
      more likely to undergo IBD-related surgery (p = 0.042) and experience an 
      IBD-related complication (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with at least 
      one colonoscopy, one visit to the gastroenterology clinic, one visit to the 
      emergency department (ED), and one hospital admission were higher in Black 
      patients (p < 0.001, p = 0.005, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001; respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Black IBD patients had more severe disease phenotypes and worse 
      healthcare outcomes than White patients. Black patients also used healthcare 
      facilities and IBD medications to an equal or greater extent, despite being of a 
      lower average socioeconomic class than their White counterparts. Our study 
      suggests that underlying factors that do not pertain to the utilization of 
      healthcare resources may be responsible for these worse outcomes in Black 
      patients.

TI  - MRTX-500 Phase 2 Trial: Sitravatinib With Nivolumab in Patients With Non-Squamous 
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Progressing On/After Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy or 
      Chemotherapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sitravatinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting TAM 
      receptors and VEGFR2, can shift the tumor microenvironment towards an 
      immunostimulatory state. Combining sitravatinib with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) 
      may augment antitumor activity. METHODS: The phase 2 MRTX-500 study evaluated 
      sitravatinib (120 mg daily) with nivolumab (every 2/4 weeks) in patients with 
      advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed on/after 
      prior CPI (CPI-experienced) or chemotherapy (CPI-naïve). CPI-experienced patients 
      had prior clinical benefit (PCB; complete/partial response or stable disease for 
      ≥12 weeks then disease progression) or no PCB (NPCB) from CPI. Primary endpoint 
      was objective response rate (ORR); secondary objectives included safety and 
      secondary efficacy endpoints. RESULTS: Overall, 124 CPI-experienced (NPCB, n = 
      35; PCB, n = 89) and 32 CPI-naïve patients were treated. Investigator-assessed 
      ORR was 11.4% in patients with NPCB, 16.9% with PCB, and 25.0% in CPI-naïve. 
      Median progression-free survival was 3.7, 5.6, and 7.1 months with NPCB, PCB, and 
      CPI-naïve, respectively; median overall survival was 7.9 and 13.6 months with 
      NPCB and PCB, respectively (not reached in CPI-naïve patients; median follow-up 
      20.4 months). Overall, (N = 156), any grade treatment-related adverse events 
      (TRAEs) occurred in 93.6%; grade 3/4 in 58.3%. One grade 5 TRAE occurred in a 
      CPI-naïve patient. TRAEs led to treatment discontinuation in 14.1% and dose 
      reduction/interruption in 42.9%. Biomarker analyses supported an 
      immunostimulatory mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS: Sitravatinib with nivolumab 
      had a manageable safety profile. Although ORR was not met, this combination 
      demonstrated antitumor activity and encouraging survival in CPI-experienced 
      patients with non-squamous NSCLC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In women with obesity, to compare full term induction of labor to 
      expectant management by cesarean delivery and other adverse outcomes. DATA 
      SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov and Cochrane Library. No 
      time, language, or geographical restrictions. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies 
      were eligible if; 1) they were cohort or randomized controlled trials; 2) 
      compared induction of labor at early or late term with expectant management; 3) 
      included women with a body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2). Studies restricted to women 
      with multiple pregnancy, pre-labor rupture of membranes, or non-cephalic 
      presentation were excluded. Primary outcome was cesarean delivery. Secondary 
      outcomes including maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidities were also 
      evaluated. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Risk of bias was assessed by 
      two authors using the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions 
      tool. Only studies assessed with low or moderate risk of bias contributed to the 
      meta-analysis. Data were combined to pooled relative risks (RR) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. Quality of evidence was 
      assessed for selected outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 232 studies identified, thirteen 
      were aligned with the inclusion criteria and four cohort studies including 
      216,318 women with induction of labor and 1,122,769 women managed expectantly 
      were included in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome. In women with 
      obesity, full term induction of labor was associated with a lower risk of 
      caesarean delivery compared to expectant management (19.7% vs. 24.5%; RR 0.71; 
      95% CI 0.63-0.81). We found the same direction of the association for other 
      selected outcomes; severe perineal lacerations (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.48-0.89), 
      maternal infection (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.21-0.84), perinatal mortality (RR 0.41; 95% 
      CI 0.18-0.90), low Apgar (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26-0.91), meconium aspiration 
      syndrome (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.28-0.56), and macrosomia (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.43-0.75). 
      Conversely, induced labor was associated with an increased risk of instrumental 
      vaginal delivery (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.22). Quality of evidence ranged from low 
      to very low. CONCLUSION: Induction of labor full term in women with obesity may 
      reduce the risk of cesarean delivery in comparison with expectant management but 
      quality of the evidence is low.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Health forecasting is an important aspect of ensuring that the health 
      system can effectively respond to the changing epidemiological environment. 
      Common models for forecasting Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) 
      are based on simplifying methodological assumptions, applied to limited 
      population subgroups, or do not allow analysis of medical interventions. This 
      study uses 5 %-Medicare data (1991-2017) to identify, partition, and forecast 
      age-adjusted prevalence and incidence-based mortality of AD as well as their 
      causal components. METHODS: The core underlying methodology is the partitioning 
      analysis that calculates the relative impact each component has on the overall 
      trend as well as intertemporal changes in the strength and direction of these 
      impacts. B-spline functions estimated for all parameters of partitioning models 
      represent the basis for projections of these parameters in future. RESULTS: 
      Prevalence of AD is predicted to be stable between 2017 and 2028 primarily due to 
      a decline in the prevalence of pre-AD-diagnosis stroke. Mortality, on the other 
      hand, is predicted to increase. In all cases the resulting patterns come from a 
      trade-off of two disadvantageous processes: increased incidence and disimproved 
      survival. Analysis of health interventions demonstrates that the projected burden 
      of AD differs significantly and leads to alternative policy implications. 
      DISCUSSION: We developed a forecasting model of AD/ADRD risks that involves 
      rigorous mathematical models and incorporation of the dynamics of important 
      determinative risk factors for AD/ADRD risk. The applications of such models for 
      analyses of interventions would allow for predicting future burden of AD/ADRD 
      conditional on a specific treatment regime.

AB  - The pathophysiology of Bradycardia-Renal Failure-Atrioventricular Nodal 
      Blockade-Shock-Hyperkalemia (BRASH) syndrome involves acute renal injury leading 
      to ineffective clearance of AV nodal agents and potassium. Theoretically, the 
      synergy between AV nodal blockade and hyperkalemic cardiac dysconduction results 
      in circulatory collapse at less-than-expected doses of both. Our study aims to 
      characterize the presentation of BRASH and provide clinical evidence of its risk 
      factors. This systematic review comprises all reported cases of BRASH until 
      February 2022. The average age and Charleston Comorbidity Index at presentation 
      was 69 years and 3.8 respectively - hypertension (71%) was most prevalent 
      followed by diabetes mellitus (48%) and chronic kidney disease (44%). The most 
      frequent presenting complaint was fatigue or syncope (49%). More than half of all 
      patients presented with non-severe hyperkalemia (less than 6.5 mmol/L) and the 
      mean serum creatinine was 3.6 mg/dL. Beta-blockers (75%) were the most commonly 
      implicated nodal agents. Presenting mean arterial pressure was 62 mmhg and heart 
      rate averaged 36 bpm; junctional escape rhythm (50%), sinus bradycardia (17.1%), 
      and complete heart block (12.9%) were generally observed on EKG. While most 
      patients responded to medical management, 20% of patients required renal 
      replacement therapy and 33% required transvenous or transcutaneous pacing. No 
      patients underwent permanent pacemaker placement and the in-hospital mortality of 
      BRASH was 5.7%. The diagnosis of BRASH requires a high index of suspicion; its 
      synergistic pathology results in a dramatic clinical presentation that can be 
      easily overlooked. As hypothesized, the degree of renal failure and hyperkalemia 
      are not congruent with the presenting circulatory shock. The significant 
      mortality of this syndrome presents an opportunity for intervention with timely 
      recognition.

AB  - Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly type 3 (MCPH3) caused by pathogenic 
      variations in CDK5RAP2, is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, 
      abnormality of skin pigmentation, ocular defects and severe microcephaly 
      associated with neurodevelopmental delay. In this study, we expand the phenotype 
      of MCPH3 as we describe a 10-year-old girl with a biallelic exonic frameshift 
      variant in CDK5RAP2 displaying previously unreported features usually associated 
      with Meier-Gorlin and microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II 
      (MOPDII). We further describe the clinical phenotype of this form of 
      centrosomal-based primary microcephaly and emphasize the importance of skeletal 
      defect screening in affected individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Discoloration of teeth following antimicrobial photodynamic therapy 
      (aPDT) is a serious concern. Common photosensitizers are colored, and access to a 
      photosensitizer that does not leave color on the teeth or is the same color as 
      the enamel and dentin is highly demanded. The physicochemical characterization, 
      anti-virulence, and antimicrobial effects of a novel rutin-gallium (III) (Rt-Ga) 
      complex as novel photosensitizer are presented herein. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Photophysical properties and cytotoxicity of the Rt-Ga complex were evaluated in 
      comparison with the parental rutin. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      generation following Rt-Ga complex-mediated aPDT was measured using the 
      fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) method. The 
      anti-biofilm effects of Rt-Ga complex-mediated aPDT on Streptococcus mutans were 
      assessed using a colorimetric assay. The virulence‑associated gtfB gene 
      expression was assessed following Rt-Ga complex-mediated aPDT by quantitative 
      real‑time PCR. RESULTS: The photophysical properties of the Rt-Ga complex 
      revealed a significant blue-shift in absorption (60 nm shift) and increased 
      extinction coefficient (4100 M -1 cm -1; at λmax = 450 nm). Average (± SEM) DCF 
      fluorescence intensities in an arbitrary unit (A.U.) were 7.1 ± 0.9, 4.1 ± 0.5, 
      and 1.7 ± 0.3 for 10.0 μM of Rt-Ga complex-mediated aPDT, 7.5 μM of Rt-Ga 
      complex-mediated aPDT, and 10.0 μM of Rt-Ga complex alone, respectively. The 
      corresponding DCF fluorescence intensities were 710% (P = 0.001), 410% 
      (P = 0.001), and 170% (P = 0.02) of the untreated S. mutans as the control group 
      (1.0 ± 0.1 A.U.), respectively. The novel Rt-Ga complex-mediated aPDT exhibited 
      no toxicity against primary human gingival fibroblast cells, a dose dependent 
      decrease in S. mutans biofilm cell survival and virulence were observed (91.4% 
      and 11.7-fold, respectively). CONCLUSION: The Rt-Ga complex-mediated 
      anti-virulence and antimicrobial photodynamic effects were superior to the one 
      caused by rutin alone making the Rt-Ga complex a more promising photosensitizer 
      than the parent material.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that photodynamic therapy (PDT) is 
      safe and effective in treating acne vulgaris. The present study aimed to evaluate 
      various PDTs on inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions in patients with acne 
      by a network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: 
      The researchers of this paper searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases from inception 
      to March 2022 to identify suitable RCTs. The included studies were evaluated for 
      methodological quality using the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool. Twenty-one 
      RCTs were included, with a total sample size of 898 participants. RESULTS: 
      Network meta-analysis (NMA) revealed that indocyanine green (ICG) + near-infrared 
      (NIR) diode laser, ICG+830 nm light-emitting diode (LED), indole-3-acetic acid 
      (IAA) + 520 nm LED, and 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) + sunlight demonstrated 
      obvious curative effects in patients with acne vulgaris. Importantly, ICG+NIR 
      diode laser provided the greatest improvement in both inflammatory and 
      non-inflammatory acne lesions (surface under the cumulative ranking curve 
      [SUCRA]: 84.4% and 93.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the NWM and SUCRA 
      ranking, ICG + NIR diode laser can be considered more effective in treating acne 
      than the other PDTs of the RCTs. However, this conclusion should be interpreted 
      with caution due to the limitations of the present study.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of promising kidney 
      protection drugs, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is), 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), dipeptidyl-peptidase IV 
      Inhibitors (DPP-4Is), aldosterone receptor agonists (MRAs), endothelin receptor 
      antagonist (ERAs), pentoxifylline (PTF), and pirfenidone (PFD), on cardiovascular 
      and kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      population. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from 
      inception to August 12, 2022. We used the Bayesian model for network 
      meta-analyses, registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42022343601). RESULTS: This network 
      meta-analysis identified 2589 citations, and included 27 eligible trials, 
      enrolling 50,237 patients. All results presented below were moderate to high 
      quality. For kidney outcomes, SGLT-2Is were optimal in terms of reducing 
      composite kidney events (RR 0.69, 95%CI 0.61-0.79), and slowing eGFR slope 
      (MD1.34, 95%CI 1.06-1.62). Then MRAs (RR 0.77, 95%CI 0.68-0.88; MD 1.31, 95%CI 
      0.89-1.74), GLP-1RAs (RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.62-0.97; MD 0.75, 95%CI 0.46-1.05), and 
      ERAs (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57-0.99; MD 0.7, 95%CI 0.3-1.1) were followed in parallel. 
      For cardiovascular outcomes, SGLT-2 inhibitors were also among the best for 
      lowing the risk of heart failure hospitalization (RR 0.67, 95%CI 0.57-0.78), 
      followed by GLP-1RAs (RR 0.73, 95%CI 0.55-0.97) and MRAs (RR 0.79, 95%CI 
      0.67-0.92). SGLT-2Is (RR 0.8, 95%CI 0.71-0.89) and GLP-1RAs (RR 0.72, 95%CI 
      0.6-0.86) had comparable effects to reduce the risk of major adverse 
      cardiovascular events. MRAs were possibly associated with increased drug 
      discontinuation due to adverse events (RR 1.21, 95%CI 1.05-1.38). For the 
      hyperkalemia outcome, MRAs (RR 2.08, 95%CI 1.86-2.33) were linked to the risk of 
      hyperkalemia, whereas SGLT-2Is (RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.65-0.93) were in contrast. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SGLT-2Is significantly reduced kidney and cardiovascular risk in 
      T2DM and CKD, subsequently GLP-1RAs and MRAs. SGLT-2Is-MRAs combination might be 
      a recommended treatment regimen for maximizing kidney and cardiovascular 
      protection but with a low risk of hyperkalemia in T2DM and CKD.

AB  - AIM: Investigate the incidence of the first diabetic foot ulcer. METHOD: This is 
      a systematic review with meta-analysis of cohort studies following PRISMA 
      (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines 
      and using RevMan software. A systematic search of Medline databases via PubMed, 
      Embase, Lilacs, Scopus databases, and Web of Science was performed until July 
      2021. In addition to investigating the incidence of the first diabetic foot 
      ulcer, the influence of the variables of the Human Development Index (HDI), 
      glycated hemoglobin, and follow-up time of the participants on the incidence of 
      the first diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) was analyzed through meta-regression. For the 
      meta-analysis of cumulative incidence and possible variable associations, RevMan 
      software was used in the Metaprop data package with 95% confidence interval (CI). 
      RESULTS: A total of 9,772 articles were identified out of which 87 were selected 
      and 12 studies ultimately included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. 
      The meta-analysis of cumulative incidence was 5.65% (95% CI: 4.20; 7.57). By 
      meta-regression, a significant inverse association was identified between DFU 
      incidence and HDI (estimate - 2.38; 95% CI - 4.10--0.67; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: 
      The study presents the cumulative incidence for the first DFU, an inexistent 
      datum in the national and international literature, and the HDI was inversely 
      associated with the incidence of DFU.

TI  - Examining the causal effect of type 2 diabetes on ischemic heart disease - A 
      longitudinal study with four measurements (1980-2017).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This longitudinal study examines a possible causal effect between type 
      2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease (IHD) by using measurements on four 
      occasions from the Swedish Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) 
      together with nationwide healthcare registers. METHODS: This was a longitudinal 
      study based on a random sample of men and women (n = 2014) from the Swedish 
      population with four measurements in the SILC every eight years. Baseline was 
      1980/81 and the participants were followed for up to 37 years. The mean age and 
      age range at baseline were 36.5 and 20-59 years, respectively. The study used 
      Marginal Structural Modeling (MSM-Cox) to account for time-varying exposures by 
      implementing inverse probability weighting (IPTW). MSM-Cox with IPTW was compared 
      with Cox proportional hazard modelling. RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) for IHD 
      (369 cases) with 95% confidence interval (CI) in participants with type 2 
      diabetes (11.1%) compared to participants without type 2 diabetes (88.9%) was 
      significantly higher (1.99; CI = 1.15 - 3.44) when using MSM-Cox with IPTW after 
      adjustments for clinical and sociodemographic risk factors. When applying Cox 
      proportional hazard models adjusted for the same variables, the HR was lower and 
      non-significant at 1.34 (CI = 0.94 - 1.98). CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study 
      with four measurements assessed a possible causal association between type 2 
      diabetes and IHD by applying MSM-Cox with IPTW. Although causality cannot be 
      determined due to the remaining risk of residual bias, the results may help to 
      elucidate a potential causal relationship between type 2 diabetes and IHD. 
      Further causal studies on possible underlying mechanisms are, however, needed.

AB  - The basal forebrain contains a phenotypically-diverse assembly of neurons, 
      including those using acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter. This basal 
      forebrain cholinergic system projects to the entire neocortical mantle as well as 
      subcortical limbic structures that include the hippocampus and amygdala. Basal 
      forebrain pathology, including cholinergic dysfunction, is thought to underlie 
      the cognitive impairments associated with several age-related neurodegenerative 
      conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. Basal forebrain dysfunction may stem, 
      in part, from a failure of normal afferent regulation of cholinergic and other 
      neurons in this area. However, little is understood regarding how aging, alone, 
      affects the functional regulation of basal forebrain afferents in the context of 
      motivated behavior. Here, we used neuronal tract-tracing combined with 
      motivationally salient stimuli in an aged rodent model to examine how aging 
      alters activity in basal forebrain inputs arising from several cortical, limbic 
      and brainstem structures. Young rats showed greater stimulus-associated 
      activation of basal forebrain inputs arising from prelimbic cortex, nucleus 
      accumbens and the ventral tegmental area compared with aged rats. Aged rats also 
      showed increased latency to respond to palatable food presentation compared to 
      young animals. Changes in activation of intrinsic basal forebrain cell 
      populations or afferents were also observed as a function of age or experimental 
      condition. These data further demonstrate that age-related changes in basal 
      forebrain activation and related behavioral and cognitive functions reflect a 
      failure of afferent regulation of this important brain region.

AB  - Common energy-intensive processes applied in oral solid dosage development, such 
      as milling, sieving, blending, compaction, etc. generate particles with surface 
      and bulk amorphous and crystal disorder. An intriguing aspect of generated 
      crystal disorder is its evolution and implication on the physical- and chemical 
      stabilities of drugs. In this review, we first examine the existing literature on 
      crystal disorder and its implications on solid-state stability of 
      pharmaceuticals. Second, we discuss the key aspects related to the generation and 
      evolution of crystal disorder, dynamics of the disordered/amorphous phase, 
      analytical techniques to measure/quantify them, and approaches to model the 
      disordering propensity from first principles. The main objective of this 
      compilation is to provide special impetus to predict or model the chemical 
      degradation(s) resulting from processing-induced manifestation in bulk solid 
      manufacturing. Finally, a generic workflow is proposed that can be useful to 
      investigate the relevance of crystal disorder on the degradation of 
      pharmaceuticals during stability studies. The present review will cater to the 
      requirements for developing physically- and chemically stable drugs, thereby 
      enabling early and rational decision-making during candidate screening and in 
      assessing degradation risks associated with formulations and processing.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the radiographic characteristics and 
      surgical removal of mesiodens among patients who had attended the Department of 
      Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial-Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the 
      Faculty of Medicine, Yamagata University. This study included 121 patients in the 
      final analysis. We retrospectively reviewed medical records including patient 
      age, sex, mesiodens number, direction, position, opportunity for detection, 
      surgical approach and operating time. The 121 patients comprised 82 males and 39 
      females. Mean age was 7.6 ± 3.1 years (range, 4-35 years). The total number of 
      mesiodens among these 121 patients was 147. Ninety-six patients had one 
      mesiodens, 24 patients had two mesiodens and 1 patient had 3 mesiodens. 
      Seventy-nine mesiodens were detected while taking X-rays for routine dental 
      examination and/or orthodontic treatment at their family dental/orthodontic 
      clinic. Mean operating time for removal of the 147 mesiodens was 32.2 ± 18.1 min. 
      Among the 96 patients with one mesiodens, mean operating time for removal of the 
      mesiodens was 30.7 ± 16.5 min. Operating time for removal of a mesiodens tended 
      to be prolonged with increased distance from the alveolar crest. Early detection 
      of mesiodens on routine radiographic check-ups and surgical planning considering 
      patient age, crown direction, position of the mesiodens will contribute to 
      improved treatment of mesiodens.

      transplantation: a single-center retrospective longitudinal analysis of 557 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Allogeneic HSCT recipients are at risk of various complications 
      during post-transplant follow-up. Some patients may refer to an emergency 
      department (ED) for medical attention, but data on ED visits by HSCT recipients 
      are lacking. OBJECTIVES: 1) Assess ED utilization in HSCT recipients and 
      associated risk factors during post-transplant follow-up. 2) Identify subgroups 
      of HSCT patients presenting to the ED. 3) Analyze outcomes and prognostic factors 
      for hospitalization and 30-day mortality after ED visits. 4) Assess mortality 
      hazards following an ED presentation. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective single-center 
      longitudinal analysis including 557 consecutive recipients of allogeneic HSCT at 
      the Medical University of Vienna, Austria, between 01/2010 and 01/2020. 
      Descriptive statistics, event estimates accounting for censored data with 
      competing risks, latent class analysis, and multivariate regression models were 
      used for data analysis. RESULTS: Out of 557 patients (median age at HSCT: 49 
      [interquartile range: 39-58] years; f:m = 233:324), 137 (25%) presented to our 
      center's ED at least once during post-HSCT follow-up (median individual 
      follow-up: 2.66 [0.72-5.59] years). Cumulative incidence estimates of a first ED 
      visit in the overall cohort were: 19% at two years, 25% at 5 years, and 28% at 10 
      years from HSCT. These numbers increased to 34%, 41%, and 43% in patients 
      resident in Vienna. Chronic GVHD was the only risk factor showing a statistically 
      significant association with ED presentation in multivariate analysis (HR 2.34, 
      95% CI 1.63-3.35). Patients presented with various and often multiple symptoms to 
      the ED. We identified three latent patient groups in the ED, mainly characterized 
      by the time from HSCT, chronic GVHD, and documented pulmonary infection. 
      Hospitalization was required in 132/216 (61%) of all analyzed ED visits; 
      in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality rates were 13% and 7%, respectively. 
      Active acute GVHD, systemic steroids, documented infection, pulmonary 
      infiltrates, and oxygen supplementation were statistically significant predictors 
      of hospitalization; shorter time from HSCT, pulmonary infiltrates, and 
      hemodynamic instability were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. ED 
      presentation during the last 30 days increased mortality hazards in the overall 
      cohort (HR 4.56, 95% CI 2.68-7.76) after adjustment for relevant confounders. 
      CONCLUSION: Every fourth patient sought the ED for medical attention at least 
      once during post-HSCT follow-up. Depending on the presence of identified risk 
      factors, a significant proportion of patients may require hospitalization and be 
      at risk for adverse outcomes. Screening for these risk factors and specialist 
      consultation should be part of managing most HSCT patients presenting to the ED.

AB  - Nervous system is segregated from the body by the complex system of barriers. The 
      CNS is protected by (i) the blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barrier between the 
      intracerebral and intraspinal blood vessels and the brain parenchyma; (ii) the 
      arachnoid blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier; (iii) the blood-cerebrospinal 
      barrier of circumventricular organs made by tanycytes and (iv) the choroid plexus 
      blood-CSF barrier formed by choroid ependymocytes. In the peripheral nervous 
      system the nerve-blood barrier is secured by tight junctions between specialised 
      glial cells known as perineural cells. In the CNS astroglia contribute to all 
      barriers through the glia limitans, which represent the parenchymal portion of 
      the barrier system. Astroglia through secretion of various paracrine factors 
      regulate the permeability of endothelial vascular barrier; in pathology damage or 
      asthenia of astrocytes may compromise brain barriers integrity.

TI  - The effect of tablet computer-based telemonitoring added to an established 
      telephone disease management program on heart failure hospitalizations: The 
      Specialized Primary and Networked Care in Heart Failure (SPAN-CHF) III Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health applications are becoming increasingly common. Prior 
      work has demonstrated reduced HF hospitalizations with HF disease management 
      programs; however, few of these programs have used tablet computer-based 
      technology. METHODS: Participants with a diagnosis of HF and at least one high 
      risk feature for hospitalization were randomized to either an established 
      telephone-based disease management program or the same disease management program 
      with the addition of remote monitoring of weight, blood pressure, heart rate and 
      symptoms via a tablet computer for 90 days. The primary endpoint was the number 
      of days hospitalized for HF assessed at 90 days. RESULTS: From August 2014 to 
      April 2019, 212 participants from three hospitals in Massachusetts were 
      randomized 3:1 to telemonitoring-based HF disease management (n=159) or 
      telephone-based HF disease management (n=53) with 98% of individuals in both 
      study groups completing the 90 days of follow-up. There was no significant 
      difference in the number of days hospitalized for HF between the telemonitoring 
      disease management group (0.88±3.28 days per patient-90 days) and the 
      telephone-based disease management group (1.00±2.97 days per patient-90 days); 
      incidence rate ratio 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 1.58; p=0.442). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The addition of tablet-based telemonitoring to an established heart 
      failure telephone-based disease management program did not reduce HF 
      hospitalizations; however, study power was limited REGISTRATION:

AB  - Lentiviruses, including equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), are considered 
      viral quasispecies because of their intrinsic genetic, structural and phenotypic 
      variability. Immunoenzymatic tests (ELISA) for EIAV reported in the literature 
      were obtained mainly by using the capsid protein p26, which is derived almost 
      exclusively from a single strain (Wyoming), and do not reflect the great 
      potential epitopic variability of the EIAV quasispecies. In this investigation, 
      the GenBank database was exploited in a systematic approach to design a set of 
      representative protein antigens useful for EIAV serodiagnosis. The main 
      bioinformatic tools used were clustering, molecular modelling, epitope 
      predictions and aggregative/ solubility predictions. This approach led to the 
      design of two antigenic proteins, i.e. a full sequence p26 capsid protein and a 
      doublestrain polypeptide derived from the gp45 transmembrane protein fused to 
      Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) that were expressed by recombinant DNA technology 
      starting from synthetic genes, and analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) 
      spectroscopy. Both proteins were used in an indirect ELISA test that can address 
      some of the high variability of EIAV. The novel addition of the gp45 
      double-strain antigen contributed to enhance the diagnostic sensitivity and could 
      be also useful for immunoblotting application.

AB  - The endogenous H(2)S plays an important role in the occurrence and development of 
      colon cancer, and is related to the abnormal blood vessels. Here, we reported on 
      a sulfhydryl hyaluronid-based hydrogel (HA-SH) synthesized by amide reaction and 
      further obtained a bacterial hydrogel by loading Thiobacillus denitrificans to 
      the hydrogel for targeting adhesion to the colon. It was found that the loaded 
      bacteria in HA-SH hydrogel can scavenge excess H(2)S in colon cancer, then 
      promote tumor vascular normalization and improve the delivery of chemotherapy 
      drug CPT to inhibit tumor progression. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments show 
      that the self-crosslinked bacterial hydrogel has satisfactory effects in 
      inhibiting tumor progression and promoting tumor vascular normalization in colon 
      cancer. This study presents an efficient method to target the colon and consume 
      overexpressed H(2)S in colon cancer to inhabit tumor progression, providing a new 
      way for oral drug treatment of colon cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia, especially when preterm, increases risk of child 
      neurodevelopmental adverse outcomes. Biological plausibility, preclinical 
      studies, and pilot clinical trials conducted by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver 
      National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-Obstetrics Fetal 
      Pharmacology Research Centers Network support the safety and utility of 
      pravastatin to prevent preeclampsia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of 
      antenatal pravastatin treatment in high-risk pregnant individuals on their 
      child's health, growth, and neurodevelopment. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted an 
      ancillary follow-up cohort study of children born to mothers who participated in 
      the Obstetrics Fetal Pharmacology Research Centers Network pilot trials of 
      pravastatin vs. placebo in individuals at high-risk of preeclampsia. 
      (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT01717586). After obtaining written informed 
      consent (and assent as appropriate), the parent was instructed to complete the 
      Child Behavior Checklist. To assess the child's motor, cognitive, and 
      developmental outcomes, a certified and blinded study psychologist completed 
      child motor, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral assessment using validated 
      tools. Given the small numbers of individuals in the studies, the 10 and 20mg of 
      pravastatin were combined into one group and compared with those in the placebo 
      group. RESULTS: Out of the 40 children born to mothers in the original trial, 30 
      (15 exposed in-utero to pravastatin and 15 to placebo) were enrolled in this 
      follow-up study. The time of follow-up, which was 4.7 [2.5-6.9] years, was not 
      different between those in the pravastatin or placebo groups. There were no 
      differences in child's body mass index percentiles per sex and corrected age, 
      rates of extremes of body mass index percentiles or the report of any other 
      medical or developmental complications between the two groups. No child born in 
      the pravastatin group had any limitation in motor assessment compared with two 
      (13.3%) children who walked with difficulty and four (26.7%) children who had 
      reduced manual abilities in the placebo group. Moreover, children born to mothers 
      who received pravastatin had non-significant higher general mean conceptual 
      ability score (98.2 ± 16.7 vs. 89.7 ± 11.0, p=0.13) and a non-significant lower 
      frequency (15.4% vs. 35.7%, p=0.38) of having a score below 85 (i.e., one 
      standard deviation lower than the mean) compared with those in the placebo group. 
      Lastly, there no significant differences in the parents' report on the Child 
      Behavior Checklist between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is 
      the first report on the long-term neuromotor, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes 
      among children exposed to pravastatin in-utero during the 2(nd) and 3(rd) 
      trimesters of pregnancy. Although the data are limited by the original trial's 
      sample size, no identifiable long-term neurodevelopmental safety signal was 
      evident with the use of pravastatin during pregnancy. This favorable neonatal 
      risk-benefit analysis justifies continued research using pravastatin in clinical 
      trials.

TI  - Discerning conversational context in online health communities for personalized 
      digital behavior change solutions using Pragmatics to Reveal Intent in Social 
      Media (PRISM) framework.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Online health communities (OHCs) have emerged as prominent platforms 
      for behavior modification, and the digitization of online peer interactions has 
      afforded researchers with unique opportunities to model multilevel mechanisms 
      that drive behavior change. Existing studies, however, have been limited by a 
      lack of methods that allow the capture of conversational context and 
      socio-behavioral dynamics at scale, as manifested in these digital platforms. 
      OBJECTIVE: We develop, evaluate, and apply a novel methodological framework, 
      Pragmatics to Reveal Intent in Social Media (PRISM), to facilitate granular 
      characterization of peer interactions by combining multidimensional facets of 
      human communication. METHODS: We developed and applied PRISM to analyze peer 
      interactions (N = 2.23 million) in QuitNet, an OHC for tobacco cessation. First, 
      we generated a labeled set of peer interactions (n = 2,005) through manual 
      annotation along three dimensions: communication themes (CTs), behavior change 
      techniques (BCTs), and speech acts (SAs). Second, we used deep learning models to 
      apply our qualitative codes at scale. Third, we applied our validated model to 
      perform a retrospective analysis. Finally, using social network analysis (SNA), 
      we portrayed large-scale patterns and relationships among the aforementioned 
      communication dimensions embedded in peer interactions in QuitNet. RESULTS: 
      Qualitative analysis showed that the themes of social support and behavioral 
      progress were common. The most used BCTs were feedback and monitoring and 
      comparison of behavior, and users most commonly expressed their intentions using 
      SAs-expressive and emotion. With additional in-domain pre-training, bidirectional 
      encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) outperformed other deep learning 
      models on the classification tasks. Content-specific SNA revealed that users' 
      engagement or abstinence status is associated with the prevalence of various 
      categories of BCTs and SAs, which also was evident from the visualization of 
      network structures. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the interplay of multilevel 
      characteristics of online communication and their association with individual 
      health behaviors.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate research findings on the role of polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids (PUFAs) in neuronal signaling. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) 
      are the building blocks of the brain and are responsible for the proper 
      functioning of neurons, synapses, and neuronal communication. The deficiency of a 
      significant component, omega-3 (ω-3) FA, in favor of omega-6 (ω-6) FA can 
      exacerbate the course of mental illness and be one of the triggers of the cascade 
      of neurodegenerative changes. PUFAs play an essential role in transmitting 
      neuronal signals, affecting brain homeostasis. Physicochemical parameters of 
      lipid layers significantly affect their functioning; interactions between lipids 
      and proteins in brain cells are critical for mechanical stability and maintaining 
      adequate elasticity for vesicle budding and membrane fusion. This paper discusses 
      the role of PUFA deficiency or inappropriate ratios in brain tissue. The 
      deficiency is a crucial element in depressive disorders and cognitive impairment, 
      while in Alzheimer's disease, there is some controversy.

AB  - The CYP124 family of cytochrome P450 enzymes, as exemplified by CYP124A1 from 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is involved in the metabolism of methyl branched 
      lipids and cholesterol derivatives. The equivalent enzyme from Mycobacterium 
      marinum was investigated to compare the degree of functional conservation between 
      members of this CYP family from closely related bacteria. We compared substrate 
      binding of each CYP124 enzyme using UV-vis spectroscopy and the catalytic 
      oxidation of methyl branched lipids, terpenes and cholesterol derivatives was 
      investigated. The CYP124 enzyme from M. tuberculosis displayed a larger shift to 
      the ferric high-spin state on binding cholesterol derivatives compared to the 
      equivalent enzyme from M. marinum. The biggest difference was observed with 
      cholesteryl sulfate which induced distinct UV-vis spectra in each CYP124 enzyme. 
      The selectivity for oxidation at the ω-carbon of a branched chain was maintained 
      for all substrates, except cholesteryl sulfate which was not oxidized by either 
      enzyme. The CYP124A1 enzyme from M. marinum, in combination with farnesol and 
      farnesyl acetate, was structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. These 
      ligand-bound structures of the CYP124 enzyme revealed that the polar component of 
      the substrates bound in a different manner to that of phytanic acid in the 
      structure of CYP124A1 from M. tuberculosis. However, closer to the heme the 
      structures were similar providing an explanation for the high selectivity of the 
      enzyme for terminal methyl C-H bond oxidation. The work here demonstrates that 
      there were differences in the biochemistry of the CYP124 enzymes from these 
      closely related bacteria.

AB  - Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation causes skin damages. In this study, we focus on 
      the involvement of mitochondrial disorders in UVB injury. Surprisingly, UVB 
      irradiation increases the amounts of mitochondria in human immortalized 
      keratinocytes HaCaT. However, further analysis shows that ATP levels decreased by 
      UVB treatment in accordance with the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential 
      (MMP), suggesting an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in UVB-irradiated 
      HaCaT cells. Mitophagy, mainly mediated by PINK1 and parkin, is critical for the 
      elimination of damaged mitochondria. Western blot results show that the levels of 
      both PINK1 and parkin are decreased in UVB-irradiated cells, indicating the 
      impairment of mitophagy. Silencing the expression of PINK1 or parkin by 
      transfection of siRNA shows essentially the same damage to the cells as UVB 
      irradiation does, including increased mitochondrial amount, decreased MMP and ATP 
      production, and enhanced apoptosis, evidencing that repression of 
      PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy plays a primary cause of UVB-caused cells 
      damages. We previously found that HaCaT cells exposed to UVB showed activation of 
      the cGAS-STING pathway and apoptosis. Here, silencing PINK1 or parkin also 
      increases the protein levels of cGAS and STING, facilitates nuclear accumulation 
      of NF-κB, and promotes the transcription of IFNβ, suggesting for the activation 
      of STING pathway. Mitophagy impairment either by UVB-irradiation or by 
      PINK1/parkin silencing initiates caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, as shown by the 
      activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP, as well as the increase of 
      Hoechst-positive stained cells and Annexin V-positive cells. Further studies find 
      that Bax-mediated permeabilization of mitochondrial membrane is critical for cell 
      apoptosis, as well as the cytosolic leakage of mtDNA in UVB-treated cells, which 
      results in cGAS-STING activation, and these processes are negatively-regulated by 
      PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy. This study reveals the involvement of 
      dysfunctional mitochondria due to impaired mitophagy in the damaging effect of 
      UVB irradiation on HaCaT cells. Restoring the mitophagy has the potential to be 
      developed as a new strategy to protect skin from UVB damages.

TI  - Ten-year outcomes of Perioperative Anaphylaxis Workup Study in Hong Kong 
      (PAWS-HK): performance of diagnostic modalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on perioperative anaphylaxis (PA) in Asia are lacking. 
      Furthermore, allergy workup for PA has largely been limited to the "silver 
      standard" of skin tests (ST). Utilizing in-vitro tests as an adjunct to ST may 
      improve and overcome these diagnostic challenges. OBJECTIVE: The Perioperative 
      Anaphylaxis Workup Study in Hong Kong (PAWS-HK) cohort was established to 
      evaluate the clinical characteristics and diagnostic tests of patients with 
      suspected PA. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of PA over a 10-year period were 
      recruited into PAWS-HK. We reviewed the medical records, tryptase elevation and 
      diagnostic tests including ST, specific IgE and basophil activation tests (BAT). 
      RESULTS: In 151 patients with PA, diagnosis was reached in three-quarters of the 
      cases (113/151, 74.8%). The most common culprits identified were neuromuscular 
      blocking agents (NMBA) (25.8%), β-lactams (17.2%) and chlorhexidine (13.9%). 
      Severe anaphylaxis was associated with female sex, older age, elevated acute 
      tryptase levels, and more cardiovascular manifestations during induction. ST 
      remained the most sensitive diagnostic modality overall (66.2%). BAT demonstrated 
      better performance for chlorhexidine and gelofusine anaphylaxis with sensitivity 
      of 80.0% and 79.6% respectively. sIgE demonstrated even higher sensitivity 
      (95.2%) than ST (85.0%) and BAT (80.0%) for chlorhexidine anaphylaxis but 
      performed poorly for other drugs. CONCLUSION: NMBAs remain the most common 
      culprit in PA. There was a higher prevalence of gelofusine anaphylaxis in our 
      cohort compared to literature. ST remain the most sensitive testing modality. 
      In-vitro tests for chlorhexidine and gelofusine showed promising results, but 
      further studies to further elucidate its use are warranted.

TI  - NMDAR-dependent synaptic potentiation via APPL1 signaling is required for the 
      accessibility of a prefrontal neuronal assembly in retrieving fear extinction.
LID - S0006-3223(23)00087-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2023.02.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been viewed as a locus 
      to store and recall extinction memory. However, the synaptic and cellular 
      mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. METHODS: We combined 
      transgenic mice, electrophysiological recording, activity-dependent cell 
      labeling, and chemogenetic manipulation to analyze the role of adaptor protein 
      APPL1 in the vmPFC for fear extinction retrieval. RESULTS: We found that both 
      constitutive and conditional APPL1 knockout decreases NMDA receptor (NMDAR) 
      function in the vmPFC and impairs fear extinction retrieval. Moreover, APPL1 
      undergoes nuclear translocation during extinction retrieval. Blocking APPL1 
      nucleocytoplasmic translocation reduces NMDAR currents and disrupts extinction 
      retrieval. We further identified a prefrontal neuronal ensemble that is both 
      necessary and sufficient for the storage of extinction memory. Inducible APPL1 
      knockout in this ensemble abolishes NMDAR-dependent synaptic potentiation and 
      disrupts extinction retrieval, while simultaneously chemogenetic activation of 
      this ensemble rescues the impaired behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our results 
      indicate that a prefrontal neuronal ensemble stores extinction memory, and APPL1 
      signaling supports these neurons to retrieve extinction memory via controlling 
      NMDAR-dependent potentiation.

      regulating adipo/lipogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity and related diseases are becoming a growing risk for public 
      health around the world due to the westernized lifestyle. Sema7A, an axonal 
      guidance molecule, has been known to play a role in neurite growth, bone 
      formation, and immune regulation. Whether Sema7A participates in obesity and 
      metabolic diseases is unknown. As several SNPs in SEMA7A and its receptors were 
      found to correlate with BMI and metabolic parameters in the human population, we 
      investigated the potential role of Sema7A in obesity and hepatic steatosis. 
      METHODS: GWAS and GEPIA database was used to analyze SNPs in SEMA7A and the 
      correlation of Sema7A expression with lipid metabolism related genes. Sema7A(-/-) 
      mice and recombinant Sema7A (rSema7A) were used to study the role of Sema7A in 
      HFD-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal 
      stem cells (ADSCs) were used to examine the role of Sema7A in adipogenesis, 
      lipogenesis and downstream signaling. RESULTS: Deletion of Sema7A aggravated 
      HFD-induced obesity. Sema7A deletion enhanced adipogenesis in both subcutaneous 
      and visceral ADSCs, while the addition of rSema7A inhibited adipogenesis of ADSCs 
      and lipogenesis of differentiated mature adipocytes. Sema7A inhibits 
      adipo/lipogenesis potentially through its receptor integrin β1 and downstream FAK 
      signaling. Importantly, administration of rSema7A had protective effects against 
      diet-induced obesity in mice. In addition, deletion of Sema7A led to increased 
      hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      reveal a novel inhibitory role of Sema7A in obesity and hepatic steatosis, 
      providing a potential new therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic diseases.

AB  - Cognitive tasks are capable of providing researchers with crucial insights into 
      the relationship between cognitive processing and psychiatric phenomena. However, 
      many recent studies have found that task measures exhibit poor reliability, which 
      hampers their usefulness for individual-differences research. Here we provide a 
      narrative review of approaches to improve the reliability of cognitive task 
      measures. Specifically, we introduce a taxonomy of experiment design and analysis 
      strategies for improving task reliability. Where appropriate, we highlight 
      studies that are exemplary for improving the reliability of specific task 
      measures. We hope that this article can serve as a helpful guide for 
      experimenters who wish to design a new task, or improve an existing one, to 
      achieve sufficient reliability for use in individual-differences research.

AB  - It is a great honor to be invited to write a reflection of my lifelong bile acid 
      research for the Journal of Biological Chemistry, the premier biochemistry 
      journal in which I am proud to have published 24 manuscripts. I published 21 
      manuscripts in the Journal of Lipid Research, also a journal of American Society 
      of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I started my reflection from my early 
      education in Taiwan, my coming to America for graduate study, my postdoctoral 
      training in cytochrome P450 research, and my lifelong bile acid research career 
      at the not so "visible" Northeast Ohio Medical University. I have witnesses and 
      help to transform this sleepy rural medical school to a well-funded powerhouse in 
      liver research. Writing this reflection of my long, exciting, and rewarding 
      journey in bile acid research brought back many good memories. I am proud of my 
      scientific contribution. I attribute my lifelong academic success to working 
      hard, perseverance, good mentoring, and networking. I hope that this reflection 
      of my academic career may provide guidance to younger investigators who are 
      pursuing academic teaching and research and might inspire the next generation of 
      researchers in biochemistry and metabolic diseases.

TI  - Design, synthesis and mechanism of action of novel μ-conotoxin KIIIA analogs for 
      inhibition of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v)1.7.
PG  - 103068

AB  - μ-Conotoxin KIIIA, a selective blocker of sodium channels, has strong inhibitory 
      activity against several Na(v) isoforms, including Na(v)1.7, and has potent 
      analgesic effects, but it contains three pairs of disulfide bonds, making 
      structural modification difficult and synthesis complex. To circumvent these 
      difficulties, we designed and synthesized three KIIIA analogs with one disulfide 
      bond deleted. The most active analog, KIIIA-1, was further analyzed and its 
      binding pattern to hNa(v)1.7 was determined by molecular dynamic (MD) 
      simulations. Guided by the MD computational model, we designed and tested 32 
      2nd-generation and 6 3rd-generation analogs of KIIIA-1 on hNa(v)1.7 expressed in 
      HEK293 cells. Several analogs showed significantly improved inhibitory activity 
      on the hNa(v)1.7, and the most potent peptide, 37, was approximately 4-fold more 
      potent than KIIIA Isomer I and 8-fold more potent than the wild-type (WT) KIIIA 
      in inhibiting hNa(v)1.7 current. Intraperitoneally injected 37 exhibited potent 
      in vivo analgesic activity in a formalin-induced inflammatory pain model, with 
      activity reaching ∼350-fold of the positive control drug morphine. Overall, 
      peptide 37 has a simplified disulfide-bond framework and exhibits potent in vivo 
      analgesic effects, and has promising potential for development as a pain therapy 
      in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Persistent symptoms on short-term follow-up after infection with 
      COVID-19 are common, but long-term consequences have been insufficiently studied. 
      The aim of this study was to characterize pulmonary function and ongoing symptoms 
      12 months after hospitalization with COVID-19. METHODS: This prospective 
      multicenter study included 222 patients hospitalized with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 
      in the Central Denmark Region. Disease severity was stratified using WHO Clinical 
      Progression Scale. Clinical characteristics, pulmonary function test (PFT), 
      6-minute walk test (6MWT), and patient-reported outcome measures were collected 
      at follow-up 3 and 12 months after discharge. Outcome measures from follow-up 3 
      months after discharge have previously been published. RESULTS: A total of 179 
      (81%) patients completed the 12-month follow-up. Median age was 60 years (IQR 51, 
      69) and 58% were male patients. At 12-month follow-up 49.7% had a normal 
      diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), while 39.4% had DLCO <80%. The 
      6MWT distance increased significantly (29m 95% CI 19, 40; p<0.01). An mMRC score 
      of 0 was reported by 51% and an mMRC≥2 by 20%. The frequency and severity of 
      fatigue, depression, and anxiety did not improve over time. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      study found that impaired DLCO percentage is common 12 months after 
      hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2 and reduction in DLCO percentage is associated to 
      dyspnea.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Blood-culture-negative infective endocarditis (BCNE) is found in 2 to 
      48% of cases of infective endocarditis (IE) [1].IE and vertebral osteomyelitis 
      due to Chlamydia sp. are difficult to diagnose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case 
      report of Chlamydia psittaci IE is provided, associated with a literature review. 
      RESULTS: We report the first case of Chlamydia psittaci IE, revealed by a 
      spondylodiscitis. Questioning of the patient, imaging, serologies and PCR 
      techniques on valves confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: C. psittaci IE is rare 
      but probably underdiagnosed. In case of negative blood cultures, questioning 
      patients with IE about their contacts with animals is relevant. PCR techniques 
      are reference tools for diagnosis confirmation when valve or vertebral samples 
      are available.

AB  - Microalgae's ability to grow in poultry slaughterhouse wastewater (PSHWW) is 
      attracting interest for low-cost biomass production and wastewater treatment. In 
      this study, PSHWW is evaluated by the cultivation of Chlorella sp. andNeochloris 
      sp. for biomass,bioproducts, and nutrient removal. Results showed that Neochloris 
      sp.produced the maximum of 1.4 g L(-1) biomass and 38% lipids compared 
      toChlorella sp. (1.3 g L(-1) and 36%). The maximum carotenoids, proteins, and 
      carbohydrates obtained from Neochloris sp. are 38 mg/g DW, 41.7%, and 29%, 
      respectively. COD, nitrite, and phosphate removal efficiencies of 96.8%, 95%, and 
      79%, respectively, by Neochloris sp. and 89%, 93.5%, and 64.5%, respectively, by 
      Chlorella sp. FTIR confirms the role of functional groups in pollutant absorption 
      by microalgae. The predominant fatty acids found were C16, C18, C18:1, C18:2, 
      C18:3, C20:5, and C22:6. The research demonstrated that microalgae can be used 
      for the treatment of wastewater, nutraceuticals, food additives, and biofuels.

AB  - Tropical fruit wastes (TFW) are considered as the major source of food and 
      nutrition in the topical countries. In the recent years, modernization of 
      agriculture has increased the tropical fruit production. Higher fruit production 
      led to an increasing abundance in the tropical fruit waste. In general, the 
      tropical fruit waste has no economic value and ends up in landfill. But in recent 
      years it was observed that the tropical fruit waste can be valorized to produce 
      value-added products ranging from compost, phytochemicals, and food products to 
      biofuels. The tropical fruit waste has great potential to produce useful products 
      in tropical areas. This review literature is an endeavor to understand the major 
      tropical fruit wastes and their composition. The review presents a detailed 
      investigation on tropical fruit waste composition, its conversion potential, role 
      of microbes in waste valorization, production of commercially valuable products 
      and future perspectives in waste valorization.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the impacts of adding different proportions of woody 
      peat (WP) (0%(CK), 5%(T1), and 15%(T2)) on denitrification during composting. The 
      results demonstrated that compared with CK, T1 and T2 increased the total 
      Kjeldahl nitrogen content (8% and 14%, respectively) and reduced the nitrate 
      nitrogen (7% and 23%) content after composting. After composting, the abundances 
      of nirK and nirS decreased by 4-9% and 33-35% under T1 and T2, respectively. 
      Adding 15% WP reduced the abundances of key denitrifying bacteria such as 
      Pseudomonas, Pusillimonas, Achromobacter, and Rhizobiales by 5-90%. The main 
      factors that affected denitrification genes were the carbon content, nitrogen 
      form (nitrite nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen), and denitrifying bacteria 
      community. In summary, adding 15% WP has the best ability to reduce nitrogen loss 
      by decreasing the abundances of denitrifying bacteria and denitrifying functional 
      genes, thereby improving the agricultural value of composting products.

AB  - The performance of β-glucosidase during cellulose saccharification is determined 
      by thermostability, activity and glucose tolerance. However, conflicts between 
      them make it challenging to simultaneously optimize three properties. In this 
      work, such a case was reported using Bgl6-M3 as a starting point. Firstly, four 
      thermostability-enhancing mutations were obtained using computer-aided 
      engineering strategies (mutant M7). Secondly, substrate binding pocket of M7 was 
      reshaped, generating two mutations that increased activity but decreased glucose 
      tolerance (mutant M9). Then a key region lining active site cavity was 
      redesigned, resulting in three mutations that boosted glucose tolerance and 
      activity. Finally, mutant M12 with simultaneously improved thermostability 
      (half-life of 20-fold), activity (k(cat)/K(m) of 5.6-fold) and glucose tolerance 
      (ΔIC(50) of 200 mM) was obtained. Mechanisms for property improvement were 
      elucidated by structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, 
      the strategies used here and new insights into the underlying mechanisms may 
      provide guidance for multi-property engineering of other enzymes.

AB  - The main aim of the present study was to establish a relationship model between 
      bio-hydrogen yield and the key operating parameters affecting photo-fermentation 
      hydrogen production (PFHP) from co-substrates. Central composite design-response 
      surface methodology (CCD-RSM) and artificial neural network-genetic algorithm 
      (ANN-GA) models were used to optimize the hydrogen production performance from 
      co-substrates. Compared to CCD-RSM, the ANN-GA had higher determination 
      coefficient (R(2) = 0.9785) and lower mean square error (MSE = 9.87), average 
      percentage deviation (APD = 2.72) and error (4.3%), indicating the ANN-GA was 
      more suitable, reliable and accurate in predicting biohydrogen yield from 
      co-substrates by PFHP. The highest biohydrogen yield (99.09 mL/g) predicted by 
      the ANN-GA model at substrate concentration 35.62 g/L, temperature 30.94 °C, 
      initial pH 7.49 and inoculation ratio 32.98 %(v/v), which was 4.20 % higher than 
      the CCD-RSM model (95.10 mL/g).

AB  - Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) are chloride channels that are 
      regulated according to intracellular calcium ion concentrations. The channel 
      protein ANO1 is widely present in cells and is involved in physiological 
      activities including cellular secretion, signaling, cell proliferation and 
      vasoconstriction and diastole. In this study, the ANO1 inhibitors were 
      investigated with machine learning and molecular simulation. Two-dimensional 
      structure-activity relationship (2D-SAR) and three-dimensional quantitative 
      structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models were developed for the 
      qualitative and quantitative prediction of ANO1 inhibitors. The results showed 
      that the prediction accuracies of the model were 85.9% and 87.8% for the training 
      and test sets, respectively, and 85.9% and 87.8% for the rotating forest (RF) in 
      the 2D-SAR model. The CoMFA and CoMSIA methods were then used for 3D QSAR 
      modeling of ANO1 inhibitors, respectively. The q(2) coefficients for model 
      cross-validation were all greater than 0.5, implying that we were able to obtain 
      a stable model for drug activity prediction. Molecular docking was further used 
      to simulate the interactions between the five most promising compounds predicted 
      by the model and the ANO1 protein. The total score for the docking results 
      between all five compounds and the target protein was greater than 6, indicating 
      that they interacted strongly in the form of hydrogen bonds. Finally, simulations 
      of amino acid mutations around the docking cavity of the target proteins showed 
      that each molecule had two or more sites of reduced affinity following a single 
      mutation, indicating outstanding specificity of the screened drug molecules and 
      their protein ligands.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diastolic myocardial stiffness (MS) can serve as a key diagnostic 
      parameter for congenital or acquired heart diseases. Using shear modulus and 
      shear wave velocity (SWV), shear wave elastography (SWE) is an emerging 
      ultrasound-based technique that can allow non-invasive assessment of MS. However, 
      MS extrinsic parameters such as left ventricular geometrical characteristics 
      could impact on shear wave propagation. OBJECTIVES: To determine a range of 
      normal values of MS using SWE in age groups of healthy children and young adults 
      and to explore the impact of left ventricular geometrical characteristics on SWE. 
      METHODS: 60 healthy volunteers (HVs) were recruited in the study and divided into 
      2 groups: "neonates" (0-1-month-old, n=15) and ">1 month old" (1 month - 45 
      years, n=45). SWE was performed using the Verasonics Vantage systems with a 
      phased array ultrasound probe. The anteroseptal basal segment was assessed in two 
      views. SWE was ECG-triggered during the end-diastolic phase. Conventional 
      echocardiography was achieved to assess ventricular function and anatomy. Results 
      are presented as stiffness values along with mean velocity measurements and SD. 
      Simple and multivariate linear regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: For 
      neonates, mean MS was 1.87 ± 0.79 kPa [min = 0.59 kPa; max = 2.91 kPa; SWV = 1.37 
      ± 0.57 m/s] with high variability and no correlation with age (p=0.239). For this 
      age group, no statistically significant correlation was found between MS and any 
      demographic or echocardiographic parameters (p>0.05). For ">1 month old" group, 
      mean MS value of 1.67 ±0.53 kPa was observed [min 0.6 kPa, max 3 kPa; SWV = 1.29 
      ± 0.49 m/s] for HV. When age-paired, no sex-related difference was observed 
      (p=0.55). In univariate linear regression analysis, age (r=0.83, p<0.01), 
      diastolic interventricular septum thickness (IVSd, r=0.72, p<0.01), and left 
      ventricle end-diastolic diameter (r=0.67, p<0.01) were the parameters with the 
      higher correlation coefficient with MS. In a multiple linear regression analysis 
      incorporating these three parameters as cofounding factors, age was the only 
      statistically significant parameters (r=0.81, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Diastolic MS 
      has a linear increase in children and young adults. Diastolic MS correlates more 
      robustly with age than with myocardial and left ventricular geometrical 
      characteristics. However, the geometry impacts on the SWV implying the need to 
      determine well established boundaries through future studies for the clinical 
      application of the SWE.

AB  - In this study, we collected feces of Tibetan piglets from Nyingchi area for 
      isolation, culture, identification, virulence gene analysis and drug resistance 
      analysis of Escherichia Coli. The results demonstrated a 41.3% isolation rate of 
      Diarrheagenic Escherichia Coli from Tibetan pigs with the main phylogenetic 
      groups: group A (68.6%) and group B2 (15.7%). Typical E.coli accounted for 76.5%. 
      The highest detection rates of porcine virulence genes were E.coli heat-resistant 
      enterotoxin STb (58.82%) and F107 fimbrial subunit (23.53%). The highest 
      detection rates of virulence genes from Tibetan pigs were fimC (80.39%) and ompA 
      (76.47%). A drug sensitivity test showed that Diarrheagenic Escherichia Coli from 
      Tibetan pigs had high drug resistance rates to mezlocillin, doxycycline and 
      gentamicin. This study comprehensively analyzed the species composition, 
      virulence and drug resistance of Diarrheagenic Escherichia Coli from Tibetan 
      pigs, which provided a clearer and more targeted idea for the prevention and 
      treatment of yellow and white dysentery in Tibetan pigs in the future.

AB  - The objective of the study was to establish the incidence, pathogenic factors and 
      antimicrobial resistance of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in seafood from retail shops 
      in Bulgaria. A hundred and eighty samples of sea fish, mussels, oysters, veined 
      rapa whelks, shrimps and squids were included in the study. PCR methods were used 
      to identify V. parahaemolyticus and prove tdh and trh genes. Antimicrobial 
      resistance was established by disc diffusion method, and MAR index was 
      calculated. The results proved the presence of V. parahaemolyticus in 24% 
      (44/180) of the seafood samples. tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus was not found, 
      while the trh gene was detected in one veined rapa whelk isolate. All isolates 
      were susceptible to Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, Tetracycline, Gentamycin, 
      Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, Amikacin, Ciprofloxacin, and Levofloxacin. 
      Intermediate resistance was found to Ampicillin (25%; 11/44), Cefepime (16%; 
      7/44), and Ceftazidime (2%; 1/44). The results showed that 16% (7/44) of the 
      isolates were resistant to Cefepime, 9% (4/44) to Ampicillin, and 5% (2/44) to 
      Ceftazidime. MAR-index values ranged from 0.10 to 0.30. The incidence of 
      pathogenic and multidrug-resistant V. parahaemolyticus strains in seafood offered 
      on the market poses a risk to consumer health.

AB  - The incidence of vaginal infection caused by Candida species has considerably 
      increased over the past two decades. Candida albicans is the main cause of 
      vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC); however, non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, such 
      as Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis, are now frequently identified in VVC 
      patients. Although the vaginal microbiome (VMB) was well studied in Candida 
      albicans-associated VVC patients, the fungal influence on bacterial communities 
      of NAC species-associated VVC and potential microbial interplay contributing to 
      VVC pathology remain elusive. We characterized VMB via Candida albicans and NAC 
      species-associated VVC patients, as Candida albicans (CA, n = 16), Candida 
      glabrata (CG, n = 16), Candida tropicalis (CT, n = 4), and recruiting healthy 
      (CON, n = 20) women as references of dysbiosis and eubiosis. The bacterial 
      diversity of the vagina in the CG group significantly declined. Further, all VVC 
      patients have a higher abundance of Lactobacillus iners, especially for the CG 
      group. Meanwhile, the predicted functions in all VVC are toned which may be 
      associated with a disruption in the bacterial network. In conclusion, according 
      to the taxonomic analysis, we found that the vaginal microbiome in C. 
      glabrata-associated VVC women is different from that of other Candida 
      species-associated VVC women, implying a different pathogenesis.

AB  - A synthetic and thermo-responsive polymer, 
      poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-(polylactide/2-hydroxy methacrylate)-co-(oligo 
      (ethylene glycol)), is used to formulate a universal carrier platform for 
      sustained drug release. The enabling carrier, denoted as TP, is prepared by 
      dissolving the polymer in an aqueous solution at a relatively neutral pH. A wide 
      range of therapeutic moieties can be incorporated without the need for the 
      addition of surfactants, organic solvents, and other reagents to the carrier 
      system. The resulting solution is flowable through fine gauge needle, allowing 
      accurate administration of TP to the target site. After injection, TP carrier 
      undergoes a coil to globe phase transition to form a hydrogel matrix at the site. 
      The benign nature of the polymer carrier and its physical gelation process are 
      essential to preserve the biological activity of the encapsulated compounds while 
      the adhesive hydrogel nature of the matrix allows sustained elusion and 
      controlled delivery of the incorporated therapeutics. The TP carrier system has 
      been shown to be non-toxic and elicits a minimal inflammatory response in 
      multiple in vitro studies. These findings suggest the suitability of TP as an 
      enabling carrier of therapeutics for localized and sustained drug delivery. To 
      confirm this hypothesis, the capabilities of TP to encapsulate and effectively 
      deliver multiple therapeutics of different physicochemical characteristics was 
      evaluated. Specifically, a broad range of compounds were tested, including 
      ciprofloxacin HCl, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth 
      factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 
      (BMP2). In vitro studies confirmed that TP carrier is able to control the release 
      of the encapsulated drugs over an extended period of time and mitigate their 
      burst release regardless of the compounds' physiochemical properties for the 
      majority of the loaded therapeutics. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo animal 
      studies showed that the released drugs from the TP hydrogel matrix remained 
      potent and bioactive, confirming the high potential of the TP polymer system as 
      an enabling carrier.

AB  - Cancer-associated fibroblasts constitute a significant component in the tumor 
      microenvironment, playing a pivotal role in tumor proliferation, invasion, 
      migration, and metastasis. Consequently, therapy combining chemotherapeutic 
      agents with tumor microenvironment (TME) modulators appears to be a promising 
      avenue for cancer treatment. In this paper, a tumor microenvironment-based 
      mPEG-PLGA nanoparticle loaded with baicalein (PMs-Ba) was constructed for the 
      purpose of improving the tumor microenvironment in cases of triple-negative 
      breast cancer. The results demonstrate that, on the one hand, PMs-Ba was able to 
      inhibit the transforming growth factor β(TGF-β) signaling pathway to avoid the 
      activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), thereby influencing the 
      interstitial microenvironment of the tumor. On the other hand, the agent led to 
      an increase in the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, activating the tumor immune 
      microenvironment. Meanwhile, in the murine breast cancer model, an intravenous 
      injection of PMs-Ba combined with doxorubicin nanoparticles (PMs-ADM) 
      significantly improved the antitumor effectiveness. These results suggest that 
      baicalein encapsulated in nanoparticles may be a promising strategy for 
      modulating the TME and for adjuvant chemotherapy, signifying a potential 
      TME-remodeling nanoformulation that could enhance the antitumor efficacy of 
      nanotherapeutics.

AB  - Existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) are primarily responsible for 
      chemoresistance, cancer reoccurrence and treatment failure in cancer patients. 
      Eliminating CSCs along with bulk tumor is a necessity to achieve complete cancer 
      inhibition. Salinomycin (SAL) has potential to specifically target and kill CSCs 
      through blocking their multiple pathways simultaneously. SAL has also been 
      reported to improve anti-cancer efficacy of numerous chemo-based drugs when used 
      in combination therapy. However, clinical use of SAL is restricted due to its 
      high off targeted toxicity. Herein, we have developed a PLA based hybrid block 
      copolymer for concomitant delivery of SAL and doxorubicin (DOX) with an aim to 
      reduce their adverse side effects and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the 
      treatment. Designed PLA based nanoplatform showed high encapsulation and 
      sustained release profile for both the drugs. Cytotoxicity evaluation on cancer 
      cell lines confirmed the synergistic effect of SAL:DOX co-loaded NPs. 
      Additionally, prepared SAL NPs were also found to be highly effective against 
      chemo-resistant cancer cells and CSCs derived from cancer patient. Most 
      importantly, encapsulation of SAL in PLA NPs improved its pharmacokinetics and 
      biodistribution profile. Consequently, undesired toxicity with SAL NPs was 
      significantly reduced which in-turn increased the dose tolerability in mice as 
      compared to free SAL. Treatment of EAC tumor bearing mice with SAL:DOX co-loaded 
      NPs resulted in excellent tumor regression and complete inhibition of cancer 
      reoccurrence. These results conclude that concomitant delivery of SAL and DOX 
      using PLA based block copolymeric nano-carrier have a strong potential for cancer 
      therapy.

AB  - The advent of scalp magnetoencephalography (MEG) based on optically pumped 
      magnetometers (OPMs) may represent a step change in the field of human 
      electrophysiology. Compared to cryogenic MEG based on superconducting quantum 
      interference devices (SQUIDs, placed 2-4 cm above scalp), scalp MEG promises 
      significantly higher spatial resolution imaging but it also comes with numerous 
      challenges regarding how to optimally design OPM arrays. In this context, we 
      sought to provide a systematic description of MEG spatial resolution as a 
      function of the number of sensors (allowing comparison of low- vs. high-density 
      MEG), sensor-to-brain distance (cryogenic SQUIDs vs. scalp OPM), sensor type 
      (magnetometers vs. gradiometers; single- vs. multi-component sensors), and 
      signal-to-noise ratio. To that aim, we present an analytical theory based on MEG 
      multipolar expansions that enables, once supplemented with experimental input and 
      simulations, quantitative assessment of the limits of MEG spatial resolution in 
      terms of two qualitatively distinct regimes. In the regime of asymptotically 
      high-density MEG, we provide a mathematically rigorous description of how 
      magnetic field smoothness constraints spatial resolution to a slow, logarithmic 
      divergence. In the opposite regime of low-density MEG, it is sensor density that 
      constraints spatial resolution to a faster increase following a square-root law. 
      The transition between these two regimes controls how MEG spatial resolution 
      saturates as sensors approach sources of neural activity. This two-regime model 
      of MEG spatial resolution integrates known observations (e.g., the difficulty of 
      improving spatial resolution by increasing sensor density, the gain brought by 
      moving sensors on scalp, or the usefulness of multi-component sensors) and 
      gathers them under a unifying theoretical framework that highlights the 
      underlying physics and reveals properties inaccessible to simulations. We propose 
      that this framework may find useful applications to benchmark the design of 
      future OPM-based scalp MEG systems.

AB  - Functional MRI (fMRI) data may be contaminated by artifacts arising from a myriad 
      of sources, including subject head motion, respiration, heartbeat, scanner drift, 
      and thermal noise. These artifacts cause deviations from common distributional 
      assumptions, introduce spatial and temporal outliers, and reduce the 
      signal-to-noise ratio of the data-all of which can have negative consequences for 
      the accuracy and power of downstream statistical analysis. Scrubbing is a 
      technique for excluding fMRI volumes thought to be contaminated by artifacts and 
      generally comes in two flavors. Motion scrubbing based on subject head 
      motion-derived measures is popular but suffers from a number of drawbacks, among 
      them the need to choose a threshold, a lack of generalizability to multiband 
      acquisitions, and high rates of censoring of individual volumes and entire 
      subjects. Alternatively, data-driven scrubbing methods like DVARS are based on 
      observed noise in the processed fMRI timeseries and may avoid some of these 
      issues. Here we propose "projection scrubbing", a novel data-driven scrubbing 
      method based on a statistical outlier detection framework and strategic dimension 
      reduction, including independent component analysis (ICA), to isolate artifactual 
      variation. We undertake a comprehensive comparison of motion scrubbing with 
      data-driven projection scrubbing and DVARS. We argue that an appropriate metric 
      for the success of scrubbing is maximal data retention subject to reasonable 
      performance on typical benchmarks such as the validity, reliability, and 
      identifiability of functional connectivity. We find that stringent motion 
      scrubbing yields worsened validity, worsened reliability, and produced small 
      improvements to fingerprinting. Meanwhile, data-driven scrubbing methods tend to 
      yield greater improvements to fingerprinting while not generally worsening 
      validity or reliability. Importantly, however, data-driven scrubbing excludes a 
      fraction of the number of volumes or entire sessions compared to motion 
      scrubbing. The ability of data-driven fMRI scrubbing to improve data retention 
      without negatively impacting the quality of downstream analysis has major 
      implications for sample sizes in population neuroscience research.

AB  - Chemotherapy resistance in advanced gastric cancer (GC) patients has largely 
      limited the effectiveness of therapy, resulting in disease recurrence and poor 
      prognosis. Gastric cancer derived mesenchymal stem cells (GCMSC) are widely 
      believed to promote GC invasion, metastasis and immune escape via up-regulating 
      programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). However, the mechanism by which PD-L1 mediated 
      by GCMSC might regulate the chemoresistance is unknown in GC. Herein, higher half 
      maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and less apoptotic rate were observed in 
      GCMSC conditioned medium (GCMSC-CM) treated GC cells exposed to cisplatin (DDP), 
      along with high expression of multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) and DNA repair 
      related genes such as Rad51. The knockdown of PD-L1 reversed the increase of 
      Rad51 mediated by GCMSC-CM, resulting in the increased sensitivity of GC cells to 
      DDP. In addition, inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) regulated the 
      expression of PD-L1 and Rad51, revealing the important role of HSP90 in GCMSC-CM 
      mediated DDP resistance. Consistent with the observations in vitro, analysis of 
      patient samples and xenograft models further confirmed that reduction of PD-L1 or 
      HSP90 weakened DDP tolerance mediated by GCMSC-CM, along with decrease of Rad51 
      and MDR1. In conclusion, we demonstrated that GCMSC-CM enhanced DDP resistance in 
      GC cells through regulating PD-L1-Rad51. It is the first to report this 
      particular mechanism of DDP resistance induced by GCMSC in GC, suggesting a 
      potential therapeutic targets for DDP resistant GC cells.

AB  - Antigen (ag)-specific T cell analysis is an important step for investigation of 
      cellular immunity in many settings, such as infectious diseases, cancer and 
      vaccines. Multiparameter flow cytometry has advantages in studying both the 
      rarity and heterogeneity of these cells. In the cellular immunologist's toolbox, 
      the expression of activation-induced markers (AIM) following antigen exposure has 
      made possible the study and sorting of ag-specific T cells without using human 
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-multimers. In parallel, assessing the cytokine profile of 
      responding T cells would support a more comprehensive description of the ongoing 
      immune response by providing information related to cell function, such as 
      polarization and effector activity. Here, a method and flow cytometry panel were 
      optimized to combine the detection of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a 
      TCR-dependent manner with the evaluation of cytokine production by intracellular 
      staining, without affecting the positivity of activation markers. In particular, 
      the expression of CD134 (OX40) and CD69 have been tested in conjunction with 
      intracellular (ic) CD137 (4-1BB) to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-specific 
      activated T cells. In our setting, CD134 provided minimal contribution to detect 
      the pool of AIM+ T cells, whereas a key role was described for ic-CD69 which was 
      co-expressed with ic-CD137 in both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. Moreover, the 
      analysis of TCR-triggered cytokine-producing T cells (IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2 were 
      assessed) further confirmed the capacity of ic-CD69 to identify functionally 
      responsive antigen-specific T cells which were often largely negative or weakly 
      positive for CD134 expression. In parallel, the use of CD45RA, CCR7 and CXCR5 
      allowed us to describe the T cell matuarion curve and detect T follicular helper 
      (Tfh) CD4+ cells, including the antigen specific activated subsets. In 
      conclusion, we optimized a method and flow cytometry panel combining assessment 
      of activation induced markers and intracellular cytokines that will be useful for 
      measuring TCR stimulation-dependent activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

TI  - m6A RNA methylation correlates with immune microenvironment and immunotherapy 
      response of melanoma.
LID - S0022-202X(23)00095-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jid.2023.01.027 [doi]
AB  - RNA methylation normally inhibits self-recognition and immunogenicity of RNA. As 
      such, it is likely an important inhibitor of cancer immune recognition in the 
      tumor microenvironment (TME), but how N6-methyladenosine (m6A) affects prognosis 
      and treatment response remains unknown. In eight independent melanoma cohorts 
      (1564 patients), the modification patterns of 21 m6A gene signatures were 
      systematically correlated with the immune cell infiltration of melanoma TME. m6A 
      modification patterns for each patient were quantified using the principal 
      component analysis (PCA) method, yielding an m6Ascore that reflects the abundance 
      of m6A RNA modifications. Two different m6A modification patterns were observed 
      in melanoma patients, separated into high and low m6Ascores that correlated with 
      survival and treatment response. Low m6Ascores were characterized by an 
      immune-inflamed phenotype, with 61.1% five-year survival. High m6Ascores were 
      characterized by an immune-excluded phenotype, with 52.2% five-year survival. 
      Importantly, lower m6Ascores correlated with more sensitive anti-PD1 and 
      anti-CTLA4 treatment responses, with 90% of patients with low m6Ascore responding 
      while 10% of those with high m6Ascore non-responding (in cohort GSE63557). At 
      single-cell and spatial transcriptome resolution, m6Ascore reflects melanoma 
      malignant progression, immune exhaustion, and resistance to ICB therapy. Hence, 
      the m6Ascore correlates to an important facet of tumor immune escape as a tool 
      for personalized medicine to guide immunotherapy in melanoma patients.

TI  - Real-time monitoring of aneurysm catheterization during stent-assisted coiling 
      for irregularly shaped intracranial aneurysms: The scope technique.
LID - S1878-8750(23)00239-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2023.02.092 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Stent-assisted coiling (SAC) using the jailing technique is a 
      well-established treatment for wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. However, low 
      volume packing which is a key factor for aneurysm recanalization can occur in 
      patients with irregularly shaped aneurysms. We have devised a real-time 
      monitoring system for aneurysm catheterization that allows the intentional 
      placement of the jailed coil-delivery microcatheter and deployed stent, referred 
      to as the "scope" technique. Herein, we present a case of irregularly shaped 
      anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm successfully treated with SAC using 
      this technique. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old woman diagnosed with an 
      unruptured wide-neck ACoA aneurysm that was eccentric to the parent ACoA and 
      overhanging posteriorly underwent SAC using this technique. Bilateral transradial 
      quadraxial systems (6-Fr Simmons guiding sheath/6-Fr intermediate catheter/3.2-Fr 
      intermediate catheter/microcatheter) were established via right and left internal 
      carotid artery. The stent-delivery microcatheter was advanced into the left A2 
      via the right A1, leaving a 0.014″ microguidewire for visualization under 
      fluoroscopic guidance. To place the coil-delivery microcatheter in the middle of 
      the aneurysm after stent deployment, the coil-delivery microcatheter was 
      cannulated into the aneurysm via the left A1, intendedly through the posterior 
      side of the stent-delivery microcatheter in the down-the-barrel view of the 
      parent ACoA (the scope technique). After stent deployment, SAC of the aneurysm 
      was successfully achieved. CONCLUSION: Using this technique, the coil-delivery 
      microcatheter was cannulated into the aneurysm, while monitoring its positional 
      relationship with the stent-delivery microcatheter in real time. This technique 
      is a useful treatment option for irregularly shaped and wide-neck aneurysms.

TI  - Vertebral Artery Injury with Anterior Cervical Spine Operations: A Systematic 
      Review of Risk Factors, Clinical Outcomes, and Management Strategies.
LID - S1878-8750(23)00231-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2023.02.078 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anterior cervical spine operations (ACSO) are commonly performed on 
      cervical spine pathologies and to a large extent are safe and successful. 
      However, these surgical procedures expose the vertebral artery (VA), posing a 
      risk of harm to it. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, 
      Google Scholar, and Web of Science electronic databases according to the 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      guidelines to critically assess primary articles discussing treatment strategies 
      "vertebral artery injury" AND "anterior cervical spine" and develop a management 
      strategy based on our experience and meta-analysis of the literature. In 
      addition, we present an illustrative case of iatrogenic vertebral artery injury 
      presenting with 6-7 months history of progressive dysphagia was transferred to 
      our care from an outside institution. RESULTS: Included and analyzed were 43 
      articles that detailed 75 cases involving vertebral artery injury (VAI) in ACSO. 
      Preoperatively, frequent clinical findings reported were sensory deficit (26 
      patients [63.41%]), motor deficit (20 patients [48.78%]), and pain (17 patients 
      [41.46%]). 32 patients (50.00%) endured injury of their left VA, and 30 patients 
      had a right VAI. The two common causes of VAI were drilling (24 patients 
      [40.00%]) and instrumentation (8 patients [13.33%]). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our 
      review recommends repair or tamponade packing with a hemostatic agent for primary 
      management. Should tamponade packing with a hemostatic agent be used for primary 
      management, secondary management should entail either repair, stenting occlusion, 
      embolization, anticoagulants, or ligation. Further examination of this treatment 
      strategy based on a larger cohort is necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvement of visualization tools in neurosurgery such as the 
      exoscope has raised the question of how this technology compares to the 
      conventional microscope for surgeon ergonomics, discomfort, and patient outcomes. 
      Exoscopes have the advantage of greater optical zoom, resolution, and 
      illumination at a lower light intensity. Heads-up display for both the primary 
      surgeon and other assistants permits neutral positioning of the surgeons while 
      placing the camera in more angled positions. In a survey sample, this study 
      assesses the surgeon experience utilizing 3D exoscope in general neurosurgery 
      cases. METHODS: Data was recorded by seven surgeons at four separate hospitals 
      utilizing a mobile phone application survey. Surgeons recorded information about 
      case type, intraoperative clinical outcomes such as blood loss and extent of 
      resection, whether fluorescence visualization was used, as well as surgeon pain 
      when compared to matched cases using conventional tools. RESULTS: 155 
      neurosurgical cases were recorded in this multi-site study, including 72% cranial 
      cases and 28% spinal. Of the cranial cases, 76% were brain tumor resections (31% 
      of which were brain metastases). Surgeons reported significantly less neck 
      (p<0.0001) and back (p<0.0001) pain in cases when using the robotic exoscope 
      compared to the conventional microscope or surgical loupes. Surgeons did not 
      convert to a microscope in any case. CONCLUSION: The exoscope provides excellent 
      delineation of tissue with high resolution. Surgeon pain was markedly reduced 
      with the robotic exoscope when compared to conventional technology, which may 
      reduce work-related injury and fatigue, potentially leading to better patient 
      outcomes.

TI  - Classification of Endoscopic Transnasal Lateral Skull-base Approaches: Anatomical 
      Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic Transnasal Approaches (ETA) to the ventrolateral 
      skull-base is commonly classified according to coronal plans or anatomical 
      structures. Our goal is to simplify the description of the ETA to lateral 
      skull-base regions in a sequential dissection with correlation to computed 
      tomography, helping in pre-operative planning, efficient surgical exposure, and 
      exposing the surgical anatomy limitations. METHODS: Five fresh injected cadaver 
      heads were dissected using an extended ETA to lateral skull-base. Each specimen 
      underwent a high-resolution computed tomography scan. A classification of the 
      lateral skull-base based on well-defined zones was proposed. RESULTS: We divided 
      the lateral target into four different zones, in a craniocaudal orientation. • 
      Zone 1 is the space lying between the orbital floor superior and the level of the 
      sellar floor inferior. • Zone 2 On a coronal plane, located between the level of 
      the sellar floor and vidian canal. • Zone 3 is the area lateral to the anterior 
      limb of the petrooccipital fissure, located between the vidian canal and the 
      carotid canal. • Zone 4 is the space located between the carotid canal and 
      extracranial opening of the hypoglossal canal, lateral to the anterior part of 
      the posterior limb of petrooccipital fissure. CONCLUSION: Multiple previous works 
      are described and classified the coronal plan and its lateral extensions. Our 
      classification system for the proposed lateral zones enables preoperative 
      planning to select a suitable approach. The craniocaudal orientation facilitates 
      the understanding of surgical corridors and tailored exposure.

TI  - A Novel Nomogram for Predicting Malignant Cerebral Edema After Endovascular 
      Thrombectomy in Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
LID - S1878-8750(23)00241-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2023.02.091 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant cerebral edema (MCE) is a common and feared complication 
      after endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This study 
      aimed to establish a nomogram to predict MCE in anterior circulation large vessel 
      occlusion stroke (LVOS) patients receiving EVT in order to guide the 
      postoperative medical care in the acute phase. METHODS: In this retrospective 
      cohort study, 381 patients with anterior circulation LVOS receiving EVT were 
      screened from 636 hospitalized patients with LVOS in two stroke medical centers. 
      Clinical baseline data and imaging data were collected within 2-5 days of 
      admission to the hospital. The patients were divided into two groups based on 
      whether MCE occurred after EVT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
      used to evaluate the independent risk factors for MCE and to establish a 
      nomogram. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients out of 381 (17.32%) developed MCE. The 
      independent risk factors for MCE included admission NIHSS ≥16 (OR, 1.851; 95% CI: 
      1.029-3.329; p =0.038), ASPECT score (OR, 0.621; 95% CI: 0.519-0.744; p <0.001), 
      right hemisphere (OR, 1.636; 95% CI :0.941-2.843; p =0.079), collateral 
      circulation (OR, 0.155; 95% CI: 0.074-0.324; p <0.001), recanalization (OR, 
      0.223; 95% CI: 0.109-0.457; p <0.001), hematocrit (OR, 0.937; 95% CI: 
      0.892-0.985; p =0.010) and glucose (OR, 1.118; 95% CI: 1.023-1.223; p =0.036), 
      which were adopted as parameters of the nomogram. The receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of 
      the nomogram in predicting MCE was 0.901(95%CI:0.848-0.940; p <0.001). The 
      Hosmer-Lemeshow test results were not significant (p = 0.685), demonstrating a 
      good calibration of the nomogram. CONCLUSIONS: The novel nomogram composed of 
      admission NIHSS, ASPECT scores, right hemisphere, collateral circulation, 
      recanalization, hematocrit and serum glucose provide a potential predictor for 
      MCE in patients with AIS after EVT.

TI  - THE PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF ERYPTOSIS PARAMETERS IN THE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID FOR 
      CEREBRALVASOSPASM AND DELAYED CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA FORMATION.
LID - S1878-8750(23)00244-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2023.02.096 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and cerebral vasospasm (VS) 
      contribute to poor outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage 
      (aSAH). The pathophysiology of DCI is not fully understood, and this has hindered 
      the adoption of a uniform definition. Reliable diagnostic tests and effective 
      evidence-based treatment are lacking. This study explored the possibility of 
      using eryptosis parameters in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a marker for early 
      detection of VS and DCI. METHODS: Twenty-one SAH patients were recruited and 
      treated at Kharkiv Regional Hospital. The occurrence of DCI and VS was also 
      recorded. Flow cytometry was used to assess eryptosis indices in the CSF by 
      analyzing phosphatidylserine externalization in erythrocytes using annexin V 
      staining and evaluating reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation using 
      2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF) staining. RESULTS: The percentage 
      of annexin-positive red blood cells (RBCs) in the VS group was significantly 
      higher than that in the non-vasospasm group (p = 0.0017). Furthermore, higher 
      values of this index were significantly associated with DCI formation (p < 
      0.0001). Patients with VS had higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of 
      DCF in RBCs compared to patients without VS (p = 0.0258). Patients with DCI also 
      had higher MFI values of DCF in RBCs (p = 0.0282). A higher percentage of 
      annexin-positive RBCs following 3 days of aSAH was correlated with poor 3-month 
      neurological outcomes (r = 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a strong 
      correlation between eryptosis level and DCI in a sizable series of patients with 
      aSAH. Correlations between eryptosis indicators in the CSF and clinical and 
      radiological manifestations suggest that eryptosis parameters are promising 
      diagnostic biomarkers for DCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma and COPD rely on inhalers to control symptoms. 
      Yet, these products remain expensive, in part because brand-name manufacturers 
      have obtained numerous patents on inhalers, including on their delivery devices. 
      Recent antitrust litigation has raised questions about the boundaries of listing 
      device patents with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), particularly when 
      patents do not claim any active ingredients. RESEARCH QUESTION: How have 
      manufacturers relied on device patents to preserve market exclusivity on 
      brand-name inhalers? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified patents on 
      brand-name inhalers approved for asthma and COPD between 1986 and 2020 using the 
      FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange 
      Book). We extracted information about patents from LexisNexis TotalPatent One and 
      Google Patents and searched device patents for mention of active ingredients or 
      other prespecified features linking the patent to the relevant drug. For each 
      inhaler, we determined the duration of protection added by device patents. 
      RESULTS: The FDA approved 53 brand-name inhalers for asthma and COPD from 1986 
      through 2020, 39 of which had at least one device patent. One hundred 
      thirty-seven distinct device patents were in the final cohort, representing 
      49% of all patents listed on inhalers. Seventy-seven percent of device patents 
      made no mention of active ingredients or their molecular structures, and 72% made 
      no mention of any relevant prespecified feature connecting the device patent to 
      the drug product. For the 39 brand-name inhalers with one or more device patents 
      listed in the Orange Book, device patents extended the duration of market 
      protection by a median of 4.7 years (interquartile range, 0.0-9.3 years) beyond 
      the last-to-expire nondevice patent. INTERPRETATION: Patent and regulatory reform 
      is needed to promote generic competition and to ensure that patients with asthma 
      and COPD have access to affordable medications.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess outcomes following image-guided ablation of recurrent or 
      unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 
      this retrospective study, 25 patients (14 female, ages 36-84) underwent 37 
      image-guided liver tumor ablation procedures to treat 47 ICC tumors (May 
      2004-January 2022). At initial diagnosis, 20 patients had Stage 1 or 2 and five 
      had Stage 3 or 4 disease. Prior to ablation, 19 of 25 (76.0%) patients had 
      progressed through prior treatments including resection (n=11), chemotherapy 
      (n=11), transarterial embolization (n=3), or radiation (n=1); six of 25 (24.0%) 
      were treatment naïve. Ablation modality selection was based on patient/tumor 
      characteristics and operator preference. Primary outcomes included local 
      progression-free survival (LPFS) and overall survival (OS) post-ablation. 
      Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analyses and Cox 
      proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Mean ablated tumor size was 2.0 ± 1.2 cm 
      (range 0.5-5.0 cm). One, 2, and 5-year KM LPFS were 84.0% (95% CI, 72.9-96.8), 
      73.0% (59.0-90.4), and 59.5% (41.6-85.1). One, 2, and 5-year secondary LPFS were 
      89.5% (80.2-99.9), 81.9% (69.4-96.6), and 75.6% (60.2-94.9). One, 2, and 5-year 
      KM LPFS for tumors ≤ 2cm were all 95.8% (88.2-100.0). One, 2, and 5-year 
      procedure-OS were 78.5% (63.5-97.2), 68.4% (51.3-91.1), and 43.5% (23.5-80.5). 
      One, 2, and 5-year diagnosis-OS were 96.0% (88.6-100.0), 78.7% (63.7-97.2), and 
      53.3% (33.1-85.9). Larger tumor size was associated with decreased time to local 
      progression (hazard ratio 1.93, p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous ablation 
      provided favorable intermediate to long-term disease control for patients with 
      recurrent or inoperable cholangiocarcinoma.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a re-emergent mosquito-borne RNA virus that causes major 
      outbreaks of encephalitis around the world. However, there is no therapeutic 
      treatment to struggle against WNV, and the current treatment relies on 
      alleviating symptoms. Therefore, due to the threat virus poses to animal and 
      human health, there is an urgent need to come up with fast strategies to identify 
      and assess effective antiviral compounds. A relevant target when developing drugs 
      against RNA viruses is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), responsible 
      for the replication of the viral genome within a host cell. RdRps are key 
      therapeutic targets based on their specificity for RNA and their essential role 
      in the propagation of the infection. We have developed a fluorescence-based 
      method to measure WNV RdRp activity in a fast and reliable real-time way. 
      Interestingly, rilpivirine has shown in our assay inhibition of the WNV RdRp 
      activity with an IC(50) value of 3.3 μM and its antiviral activity was confirmed 
      in cell cultures. Furthermore, this method has been extended to build up a 
      high-throughput screening platform to identify WNV polymerase inhibitors. By 
      screening a small chemical library, novel RdRp inhibitors 1-4 have been 
      identified. When their antiviral activity was tested against WNV in cell culture, 
      4 exhibited an EC(50) value of 2.5 μM and a selective index of 12.3. Thus, 
      rilpivirine shows up as an interesting candidate for repurposing against 
      flavivirus. Moreover, the here reported method allows the rapid identification of 
      new WNV RdRp inhibitors.

TI  - Impact of supplementary air filtration on aerosols and particulate matter in a UK 
      hospital ward: a case study.
LID - S0195-6701(23)00060-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jhin.2023.02.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aerosol spread of SARS-CoV-2 is a major problem in hospitals, leading 
      to an increase in supplementary HEPA filtration aimed at reducing nosocomial 
      transmission. We report a natural experiment that occurred when an air-cleaning 
      unit (ACU) on a medicine for older people ward was accidentally switched off 
      while being commissioned. AIM: To assess aerosol transport within the ward and 
      determine whether the ACU reduced airborne particulate matter (PM) levels. 
      METHODS: An ACU was placed in a ward comprising two 6-bedded bays plus three 
      single-bed isolation rooms, which had previously experienced several COVID-19 
      outbreaks. During commissioning, real-time measurements of key indoor air quality 
      parameters (PM1-10, CO(2), temperature and humidity) were collected from multiple 
      sensors over two days. During this period, the ACU was accidentally switched off 
      for approximately 7 hours, allowing the impact of the intervention on PM to be 
      assessed. FINDINGS: The ACU greatly reduced PM counts (e.g. PM1: 65.5 - 78.2%) 
      throughout the ward (p<0.001 all sizes), with all PM fractions and CO(2) 
      positively correlated (r = 0.343 - 0.817; all p<0.001). PM counts rose/fell 
      simultaneously when ACU was off, with PM signals from multiple locations 
      correlated (e.g., r = 0.343 - 0.868 (all p<0.001) for particulates <1μm). 
      CONCLUSION: Aerosols rapidly migrated between the various ward sub-compartments, 
      suggesting that social distancing alone cannot prevent nosocomial transmission of 
      SARS-CoV-2, as it fails to mitigate longer-range (>2m) transmission. The ACU 
      greatly reduced PM levels throughout the ward space indicating its potential as 
      an effective intervention to reduce the risk posed by infectious airborne 
      particles.

AB  - NADH-OH, the specific inhibitor of NADH-binding site of the mammalian complex I, 
      is shown to completely block FMN-dependent reactions of P. denitrificans enzyme 
      in plasma membrane vesicles: NADH oxidation (in a competitive manner with K(i) of 
      1 nM) as well as reduction of pyridine nucleotides, ferricyanide and oxygen in 
      the reverse electron transfer. In contrast to these activities, the reverse 
      electron transfer to hexaammineruthenium (III) catalyzed by plasma membrane 
      vesicles is insensitive to NADH-OH. To explain these results, we hypothesize the 
      existence of a non-FMN redox group of P. denitrificans complex I that is capable 
      of reducing hexaammineruthenium (III), which is corroborated by the complex 
      kinetics of NADH: hexaammineruthenium (III)-reductase activity, catalyzed by this 
      enzyme. A new assay procedure for measuring succinate-driven reverse electron 
      transfer catalyzed by P. denitrificans complex I to hexaammineruthenium (III) is 
      proposed.

AB  - Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) limits survival after lung 
      transplantation. Noxious stimuli entering the airways foster the development and 
      progression of CLAD. Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) link innate and adaptive 
      immunity, and exhibit regional and functional specialization in the lung. The 
      transcription factor basic leucine zipper ATF-like 3 (BATF3) is absolutely 
      required for the development of type 1 cDCs (cDC1s), which reside in the airway 
      epithelium and have variable responses depending on context. We studied the role 
      of BATF3 in a mouse minor alloantigen-mismatched orthotopic lung transplant model 
      of CLAD with and without airway inflammation triggered by repeated administration 
      of intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that cDC1s accumulated in 
      allografts compared with isografts, and that donor cDC1s were gradually replaced 
      by recipient cDC1s. LPS administration increased the number of cDC1s and enhanced 
      their state of activation. We found that Batf3(-/-) recipient mice experienced 
      reduced acute rejection in response to LPS; in contrast, Batf3(-/-) donor grafts 
      underwent enhanced lung and skin allograft rejection and drove augmented 
      recipient CD8(+) T cell expansion in the absence of LPS. Our findings suggest 
      that donor and recipient cDC1s have differing and context-dependent roles in this 
      model and may represent a therapeutic target in lung transplantation.

AB  - CONTEXT: Palliative care services are commonly provided to hospitalized patients, 
      but accurately predicting who needs them remains a clinical challenge. OBJECTIVE: 
      To assess the effectiveness on clinical outcomes of an artificial intelligence 
      (AI)/machine learning (ML) decision support tool for predicting patient need for 
      palliative care services in the hospital. METHODS: The study design was a 
      pragmatic, cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge clinical trial in 12 nursing units 
      at two hospitals over a 15-month period between August 19, 2019, and November 17, 
      2020. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either a medical service 
      consultation recommendation triggered by an AI/ML tool predicting the need for 
      palliative care services or usual care. The primary outcome was palliative care 
      consultation note. Secondary outcomes included: hospital readmissions, length of 
      stay, transfer to intensive care and palliative care consultation note by nursing 
      unit. RESULTS: A total of 3183 patient hospitalizations were enrolled in the 
      trial. Of eligible patients, A total of 2544 patients were randomized to the 
      decision support tool (1212; 48%) and usual care (1332; 52%). Of these, 1717 
      patients (67%) were retained for analyses. Patients randomized to the decision 
      support tool had a statistically significant higher incidence rate of palliative 
      care consultation compared to the control group (IRR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.11-1.92]). 
      Exploratory evidence suggested that the decision support tool group reduced 
      60-day and 90-day hospital readmissions (OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.57, 0.97]) and (OR, 
      0.72 [95% CI, 0.55-0.93]) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical decision support 
      tool integrated into a palliative care practice and leveraging an AI/ML algorithm 
      demonstrated an increase in the rate of speciality palliative care consultation 
      among hospitalized patients and reductions in hospitalizations.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purine nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is released 
      into extracellular spaces as extracellular ATP (eATP) as a consequence of cell 
      injury or death and activates the purinergic receptors. Once released, eATP may 
      facilitate T-lymphocyte activation and differentiation. The purpose of this 
      review is to elucidate the role of ATP-mediated signaling in the immunological 
      events related to type 1 diabetes (T1D). RECENT FINDINGS: T lymphocytes mediate 
      immune response during the onset of T1D and promote pancreatic islet or whole 
      pancreas rejection in transplantation. Recent data suggest a potential role for 
      eATP in early steps of T1D onset and of allograft rejection. In different 
      preclinical experimental models and clinical trials, several drugs targeting 
      purinergic signaling have been employed to abrogate lymphocyte activation and 
      differentiation, thus representing an achievable treatment to prevent/revert T1D 
      or to induce long-term islet allograft function. SUMMARY: In preclinical and 
      clinical settings, eATP-signaling inhibition induces immune tolerance in 
      autoimmune disease and in allotransplantation. In this view, the purinergic 
      system may represent a novel therapeutic target for auto- and allo-immunity.

AB  - Malaria as vector-borne disease remains important health concern with over 200 
      million cases globally. Novel antimalarial medicines and more effective vaccines 
      must be developed to eliminate and eradicate malaria. Appraisal of preceding 
      genome editing approaches confirmed the CRISPR/Cas nuclease system as a novel 
      proficient genome editing system and a tool for species-specific diagnosis, and 
      drug resistance researches for Plasmodium species, and gene drive to control 
      Anopheles population. CRISPR/Cas technology, as a handy tool for genome editing 
      can be justified for the production of transgenic malaria parasites like 
      Plasmodium transgenic lines expressing Cas9, chimeric Plasmodium transgenic 
      lines, knockdown and knockout transgenic parasites, and transgenic parasites 
      expressing alternative alleles, and also mutant strains of Anopheles such as only 
      male mosquito populations, generation of wingless mosquitoes, and creation of 
      knock-out/ knock-in mutants. Though, the incorporation of traditional methods and 
      novel molecular techniques could noticeably enhance the quality of results. The 
      striking development of a CRISPR/Cas-based diagnostic kit that can specifically 
      diagnose the Plasmodium species or drug resistance markers is highly required in 
      malaria settings with affordable cost and high-speed detection. Furthermore, the 
      advancement of genome modifications by CRISPR/Cas technologies resolves 
      contemporary restrictions to culturing, maintaining, and analyzing these 
      parasites, and the aptitude to investigate parasite genome functions opens up new 
      vistas in the better understanding of pathogenesis.

AB  - Drug addiction is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with more than 70,000 
      Americans dying from drug overdose in 2019 alone. While only a small percentage 
      of chronic drug users escalate to drug addiction, little is understood on the 
      precise mechanisms of this susceptibility. Early life adversity is causally 
      relevant to adult psychiatric disease and may contribute to the risk of 
      addiction. Here we review recent pre-clinical evidence showing that early life 
      exposure to stress and/or drugs regulates changes in behavior, gene expression, 
      and the epigenome that persist into adulthood. We summarize the major findings 
      and gaps in the preclinical literature, highlighting studies that demonstrate the 
      often profound differences between female and male subjects.

AB  - Enduring patterns of epigenomic and transcriptional plasticity within the 
      mesolimbic dopamine system contribute importantly to persistent behavioral 
      adaptations that characterize substance use disorders (SUD). While drug addiction 
      has long been thought of as a disorder of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission, 
      therapeutic interventions targeting receptor mediated DA-signaling have not yet 
      resulted in efficacious treatments. Our laboratory recently identified a 
      non-canonical, neurotransmission-independent signaling moiety for DA in brain, 
      termed dopaminylation, whereby DA itself acts as a donor source for the 
      establishment of post-translational modifications (PTM) on substrate proteins 
      (e.g., histone H3 at glutamine 5; H3Q5dop). In our previous studies, we 
      demonstrated that H3Q5dop plays a critical role in the regulation of neuronal 
      transcription and, when perturbed within monoaminergic neurons of the ventral 
      tegmental area (VTA), critically contributes to pathological states, including 
      relapse vulnerability to both psychostimulants (e.g., cocaine) and opiates (e.g., 
      heroin). Importantly, H3Q5dop is also observed throughout the mesolimbic DA 
      reward pathway (e.g., in nucleus accumbens/NAc and medial prefrontal cortex/mPFC, 
      which receive DA input from VTA). As such, we investigated whether H3Q5dop may 
      similarly be altered in its expression in response to drugs of abuse in these 
      non-dopamine-producing regions. In rats undergoing extended abstinence from 
      cocaine self-administration (SA), we observed both acute and prolonged 
      accumulation of H3Q5dop in NAc, but not mPFC. Attenuation of H3Q5dop in NAc 
      during drug abstinence reduced cocaine-seeking and affected cocaine-induced gene 
      expression programs associated with altered dopamine signaling and neuronal 
      function. These findings thus establish H3Q5dop in NAc, but not mPFC, as an 
      important mediator of cocaine-induced behavioral and transcriptional plasticity 
      during extended cocaine abstinence.

AB  - Micro and nanoplastics are ubiquitous pollutants that can cause adverse health 
      effects even in humans. Effects of virgin and oxidised (simulating the aging 
      processes) polystyrene nano (nPS) and micro particles (mPS) with diameters of 0.1 
      and 1 µm were studied on human professional phagocytes (i.e., monocyte cells 
      THP-1 and macrophage-like mTHP-1 cells). After characterization by ATR-FTIR, 
      UV-Vis spectroscopy, SEM and dynamic light-scattering analyses, the particles 
      were FITC functionalised to quantify cellular uptake. Changes in the cell 
      compartments were studied by acrydine orange and the pro-oxidant, cytotoxic and 
      genotoxic effects were assessed. Phagocytosis was dose- and time- dependent and 
      at 24 h 52% of nPS and 58% of mPS were engulfed. Despite the high homeostasis of 
      professional phagocytes, significant ROS increases and DNA damage were observed 
      after exposure to oxidised particles. The results highlight that the 
      environmental aging processes enhances the adverse health effects of micro and 
      nanoplastics.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute pancreatitis is a frequent inflammatory gastrointestinal 
      disorder with high mortality rates in severe forms. An early evaluation of its 
      severity is key to identify high-risk patients. This study assessed the influence 
      of waist circumference together with hypertriglyceridemia on the severity of 
      acute pancreatitis. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed, which included 
      patients admitted with acute pancreatitis from March 2014 to March 2021. Patients 
      were classified into four phenotype groups according to their waist circumference 
      and triglyceride levels: normal waist circumference and normal triglycerides; 
      normal waist circumference and elevated triglycerides; enlarged waist 
      circumference and normal triglycerides; and enlarged waist circumference and 
      triglycerides, namely hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTGW) phenotype. Clinical 
      outcomes were compared among the groups. RESULTS: 407 patients were included. 
      Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and intensive care unit admission 
      were most frequent among patients in the HTGW phenotype group, at 44.9% and 8.2%, 
      respectively. The incidence of local complications was higher in the normal waist 
      circumference with elevated triglycerides group (27%). On multivariable analysis, 
      an enlarged waist circumference was related to an increase of 4% and 2% in the 
      likelihood of developing organ failure and SIRS, respectively. 
      Hypertriglyceridemia was an independent risk factor for both organ failure and 
      local complications. CONCLUSIONS: HTGW phenotype was significant related to 
      developing of SIRS. It seems that an enlarged waist circumference has a greater 
      role than hypertriglyceridemia in the development of SIRS. Obesity and 
      hypertriglyceridemia were both independent risk factors for organ failure. 
      Patients with hypertriglyceridemia were more likely to develop local 
      complications.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second cause of cancer-related 
      deaths worldwide. Five-year survival rate in Spain is 57%. The most important 
      prognostic factor is the stage of the tumor at the diagnosis. CRC can be early 
      diagnosed, but the adherence to screening programs is low (<50%). This study aims 
      to ascertain the influence of social support and stressful life events on the 
      adherence to the population screening of CRC with Faecal Occult Blood Test in 
      Spanish average risk population. METHODS: Multicenter case-control study. We 
      conducted a simple random sampling among individuals invited to participate in 
      the colorectal cancer screening programme. We analyzed epidemiological and social 
      variables associated with lifestyle and behavioral factors. We performed a 
      descriptive and a bivariant analyses and a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 
      408 patients (237 cases and 171 controls) were included. Multivariant analyses 
      showed independent association between higher adherence to the screening program 
      and older age (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.10), stable partner (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 
      1.08-2.89) and wide social network (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.07-2.66). Otherwise, 
      lower adherence was associated to perceiving barriers to participate in the 
      program (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88-0.96). We find a statistically significant 
      association between lower adherence and high impact stressful life events in the 
      bivariant analyses, and the tendency was maintained (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0,37-1,08) 
      in the multivariant. CONCLUSION: Social variables decisively influence the 
      adherence to colorectal cancer screening. The implementation of social 
      interventions that improve social support, reduce impact of stressful life events 
      and the design of screening programs that decrease the perceived barriers, will 
      contribute to increase the participation on these programs. Secondary, the 
      colorectal cancer diagnosis will be made in early-stages with the consequent 
      mortality reduction.

AB  - Enhanced tactile acuity in blindness is among the most widely reported results of 
      neuroplasticity following prolonged visual deprivation. However, tactile 
      submodalities other than discriminative touch are profoundly understudied in 
      blind individuals. Here, we examined the influence of blindness on two tactile 
      submodalities, affective and discriminative touch, the former being vital for 
      social functioning and emotional processing. We tested 36 blind individuals and 
      36 age- and sex-matched sighted volunteers. In Experiment 1, we measured the 
      perception of affective tactile signals by asking participants to rate the 
      pleasantness of touch delivered on the palm (nonhairy skin, sparsely innervated 
      with C tactile [CT] fibers) or the forearm (hairy skin, densely innervated with 
      CT fibers) in a CT-optimal versus a CT-nonoptimal manner using a paradigm 
      grounded in studies on tactile sensory neurophysiology. In Experiment 2, we 
      implemented a classic task assessing discriminative touch abilities, the grating 
      orientation task. We found that blind individuals rated the touch as more 
      pleasant when delivered on the palm than on the forearm, while the opposite 
      pattern was observed for sighted participants, who rated stimulation on the 
      forearm as more pleasant than stimulation on the palm. We also replicated the 
      previous findings showing enhanced discriminative tactile acuity in blind 
      individuals. Altogether, our results suggest that blind individuals might 
      experience affective touch differently than sighted individuals, with relatively 
      greater pleasantness perceived on the palm. These results provide a broader 
      insight into somatosensory perception in blind individuals, for the first time 
      taking into consideration the socioemotional aspect of touch.

AB  - Schizophrenia is one of the major neuropsychiatric disorders affecting 1% of the 
      population worldwide. Neuroinflammation, neurodevelopment, and oxidative stress 
      are some of the crucial factors that can contribute to the pathogenesis of 
      Schizophrenia. Klotho gene is an antiaging gene whose dysregulated expression can 
      lead to Schizophrenia and aging-like symptoms in patients. Klotho gene expression 
      is regulated by miRNA- 339, which might lead to expression changes of the klotho 
      gene in schizophrenia patients. This study aimed to determine the Role of miRNA- 
      339-5p in the Regulation of Klotho Gene Expression and its Circulatory Levels in 
      Schizophrenia. In this study total of 60 cases, schizophrenia patients and 30 
      healthy controls were recruited, and written informed consent was obtained from 
      all the study subjects. The klotho gene and miRNA - 339-5p expressions were done 
      using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. And relative fold change 
      expression was calculated by Livaak's method, that is 2^-double delta ct. It was 
      found that the klotho gene is around 2.08 times upregulated as compared to 
      healthy control, and miRNA- 339-5p was downregulated and showed an inverse 
      relationship. The present study is the first to evaluate the klotho gene 
      expression and correlate it with miRNA- 339-5p. Further confirmation of the 
      results study should be planned with a large sample size and with drug naïve 
      patients.

AB  - Trichloroethylene (TCE), a widespread environmental contaminant, has been linked 
      to congenital heart defects. Abnormal regulation of Connexin 43 is closely 
      associated with various cardiac diseases. However, it is yet to be established 
      how Cx43 responds to environmental pollutants. Here, we aim to explore the role 
      of Cx43 in TCE-induced cardiac toxicity using H9C2 cardiomyocytes. EdU 
      incorporation assay and cell cycle analysis revealed that increased number of 
      TCE-treated cells entered into the S stage, indicating that TCE exposure provoked 
      cell proliferation. Additionally, compromised mitochondrial function was observed 
      in TCE-treated cells, and inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition 
      pore (mPTP) with Cyclosporin A or eliminating mitochondrial ROS by MitoQ 
      alleviated the TCE-induced cardiac toxicity. Importantly, TCE exposure increased 
      the protein expression levels of Cx43 and stimulated the recruitment of Cx43 to 
      the mitochondria. TCE exposure disrupted canonical Wnt signal pathway, resulting 
      in downregulation of antioxidant genes and β-catenin. The adverse effects of TCE 
      on Wnt signal pathway activation, mitochondrial function and cell proliferation 
      were efficiently counteracted by either Cx43 knockdown or pharmaceutical 
      activator of Wnt signaling, CHIR-99021. Taken together, our results for the first 
      time revealed that dysregulation of Cx43 mediates TCE-induced heart defects via 
      mitochondrial dysfunction and Wnt signaling inhibition, suggesting that Cx43 can 
      be a potential molecular marker or therapeutic target for cardiac diseases caused 
      by environmental pollutants.

AB  - Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) suffer from high operational and cleaning costs due 
      to biofouling. The biofouling begins when the adhesins (an anchor-type epitope 
      made up of polar and charged amino acids) on microbial appendages bind to the 
      surface. Two different compounds-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) and methyl 
      α-d-mannopyranoside (MeαMan)-were investigated as possible biofilm mitigation 
      tools due to their documented anti-adhesin properties in the biomedical field. 
      DDM prevented up to 56.3, 87.0, and 67.6% of the formation of Pseudomonas putida, 
      Escherichia coli and wastewater culture biofilms, respectively, in microplate 
      experiments. MeαMan increased biofilm in the microplates. In a biofilm reactor 
      setting, DDM was then applied on typical membrane materials, polyvinylidene 
      fluoride, polyamide, polyether-sulfone, and polyacrylonitrile and prevented 79.4, 
      62.5, 81.3, and 68.2% of the detectable wastewater culture biofilm formation, 
      respectively. The mechanism of anti-adhesion was the binding of the polar head of 
      the DDM to the polar amino acids of the microbial appendages in conjunction with 
      the orientation of the DDM as it binds different membrane materials. If the 
      anti-adhesins are effective at increasing the distance of the bacteria from the 
      membrane materials, they will serve as a new method for delaying biofouling.

AB  - This study evaluated the occurrence and distribution of largely known pollutants 
      (Ag, Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, Pd, and Zn), as well as emerging ones (Li, and V) in 
      the water dissolved fraction, suspended particulate matter, and surface sediments 
      from the lower course of the Negro River, Argentina. There are scarce preceding 
      data on inorganic pollution in the entire watershed and, in the case of the 
      emerging pollutants, there are almost no studies performed worldwide. Sampling 
      was conducted in 2019 at six sampling sites, three of them mostly river dominated 
      and the rest under marine domain. The samples were subjected to an acid digestion 
      in a microwave digester, and analyzed using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic 
      Emission Spectrometer. Results: revealed that Cu, Li, V, and Zn were always on 
      the top four of the highest average metal concentrations in water and sediment 
      fractions. The pollution assessment indicated that the watershed might be exposed 
      to anthropogenic pollution, as over 60% of Cu and Zn, and over 85% of Hg in water 
      dissolved samples from the marine dominated sites were above the maximum 
      recommended values from guidelines. The multivariate analyses characterized the 
      watershed into two clusters, with metals in the sediment fraction mainly 
      contributing to the uppermost sites. Indeed, sedimentary Cu and Zn background 
      enrichment indices pointed out a moderate pollution of the river dominated sites. 
      This study highlights the relevance of an integrative approach in metal pollution 
      evaluation, as the results denoted a progressive deterioration of the watershed, 
      affecting the water quality of the lower course of the Negro River and its 
      adjacent coastal zone. Overall, these results contribute to a more complete 
      evaluation of the potential to fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals, with 
      implications for future treatment strategies to enhance the environmental quality 
      of the area.

AB  - World estimated municipal solid waste generating at an alarming rate and its 
      disposal is a severe concern of today's world. It is equivalent to 0.79 kg/d per 
      person footprint and causing climate change; health hazards and other 
      environmental issues which need attention on an urgent basis. Waste to energy 
      (WTE) considers as an alternative renewable energy potential to recover energy 
      from waste and reduce the global waste problems. WTE reduced the burden on fossil 
      fuels for energy generation, waste volumes, environmental, and greenhouse gases 
      emissions. This critical review aims to evaluate the source of solid waste 
      generation and the possible routes of waste management such as biological 
      landfill and thermal treatment (Incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification). 
      Moreover, a comparative evaluation of different technologies was reviewed in 
      terms of economic and environmental aspects along with their limitations and 
      advantages. Critical literature revealed that gasification seemed to be the 
      efficient route and environmentally sustainable. In addition, a framework for the 
      gasification process, gasifier types, and selection of gasifiers for MSW was 
      presented. The country-wise solutions recommendation was proposed for solid waste 
      management with the least impact on the environment. Furthermore, key issues and 
      potential perspectives that require urgent attention to facilitate global 
      penetration are highlighted. Finally, practical implications of membrane and 
      comparison membrane-based separation technology with other conventional 
      technologies to recover bioenergy and resources were discussed. It is expected 
      that this study will lead towards practical solution for future advancement in 
      terms of economic and environmental concerns, and also provide economic 
      feasibility and practical implications for global penetration.

AB  - Photocatalytic 2e(-) ORR paves a promising avenue for hydrogen peroxide 
      (H(2)O(2)) production. However, the obscure structure-activity relationship 
      between a specific structure and photocatalytic 2e(-) ORR restricts the 
      understanding of its intrinsic mechanism. In this work, Metal-Organic Frameworks 
      (MOFs) with missing linker-cluster domain (MLCD) defects were employed as a model 
      to shed new light on the effect of MLCD defect on photocatalytic 2e(-) ORR, which 
      mainly focused on the radical reaction and electron behavior. Experiments and 
      theoretical calculations revealed that incorporating MLCD defects significantly 
      lowered the contribution rate of reactive superoxide radical (·O(2)(-)). 
      Meanwhile, the retarded interfacial charge transfer via "Ti-O″ bridge was caused 
      by the undesirable electron dissipation and augmented orbital-limited resistance 
      induced by electron spin polarization. Therefore, the photocatalytic 2e(-) ORR 
      activity was decreased to 30% of its origin by construction MLCD defects. This 
      study provides insights into the internal mechanism of photocatalytic 2e(-) ORR 
      for designing and optimizing excellent defective nanomaterials.

AB  - Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) pose a great threat to water 
      environment security. In this study, acyclovir (ACV) was efficiently degraded by 
      thermally activated persulfate (TAP) system. The ACV degradation increased with 
      rising reaction temperature and persulfate dosage. With the existence of 
      inorganic anions and humic acid, ACV removal was retarded to varying degrees. 
      Under strong alkaline condition, it was observed that the degradation of ACV was 
      significantly inhibited. In addition, Kintecus software was employed to simulate 
      ACV removal and achieved a good fit with the experimental results. The 
      contribution rates of main reactive radicals under acidic, neutral, and alkaline 
      conditions were investigated, and the contribution of hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) 
      increased significantly under alkaline condition. The main active species were 
      identified as sulfate radical (SO(4)⋅(-)) and ⋅OH through quenching experiment, 
      and the second-order reaction rate constants of SO(4)⋅(-) and ∙OH reacted with 
      ACV were calculated to be 9.17 × 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) and 2.74 × 10(9) M(-1) s(-1), 
      respectively. The main degradation pathways included addition of free radicals, 
      oxidation of branch chain and ring opening. The acute and chronic toxicity of 
      intermediates to organisms predicted by ECOSAR were significantly reduced 
      compared with that of ACV.

AB  - Time-synchronized, 24 h integrated PM(2.5) trace element (TE) measurements made 
      as a part of the COALESCE project (Venkataraman et al., 2020) at Bhopal, Mesra, 
      and Mysore during all of 2019 were analyzed in this study. The concentrations of 
      15 key elements ranged between 0.05 ng m(-3) and 50 μg m(-3) across the study 
      sites. Pronounced seasonal variation of elements from multiple source classes 
      showed that the crustal origin elements (Al, Si, Fe, Ti, and Ca) peaked during 
      the pre-monsoon season, while the anthropogenic activities driven element (P, S, 
      K, V, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Pb) concentrations increased during the winter and 
      post-monsoon seasons. Spearman correlation coupled with hierarchical clustering 
      separated the matrix of elements into three common clusters at all sites, 
      corresponding to crustal sources, combustion and biomass burning emissions, and 
      industrial/non-exhaust vehicular emissions, respectively. Furthermore, episodes 
      of metal pollution throughout the year were examined using characteristic radar 
      charts of TEs to identify the association between TE sources and poor air 
      quality. For example, maximum metal pollution in Bhopal occurred during the 
      post-monsoon season, attributable to biomass burning, dust storms, industrial and 
      non-exhaust vehicular emissions. Finally, an ecological risk assessment revealed 
      that the risk index was higher than the threshold value of 600 for all heavy 
      metals at all sites. Pb, Cu, and Zn were the top contributors to 'extremely high 
      risk' amongst all heavy metals. Overall, the results show that although TE 
      concentrations at all three locations were much lower than in other urban 
      locations in India, the risk from heavy metals to the ecosystem (and likely to 
      human health) cannot be ignored. The findings warrant a full source apportionment 
      of fine PM to better identify TE-rich source contributions and future studies to 
      examine the atmospheric processing and eco-system uptake of TEs.

AB  - E-cigarette use is prevalent among youth in the United States. Historically, 
      local communities have been a catalyst for adopting evidence-based tobacco 
      control policies. However, some states have ceiling preemption laws that prevent 
      more stringent statutes from being enacted at the city or county level and 
      inhibit tobacco control efforts. The current study documents state preemption 
      laws regarding e-cigarette advertising, licensure, indoor clean air, and youth 
      access. We conducted a systematic synthesis of state statutes to identify states 
      with e-cigarette preemption laws. Data were collected on four policy categories 
      being preempted: advertising, licensure, clean indoor air, and youth access. Laws 
      were compiled, and the content was verified using the Westlaw legal database. In 
      the US, 25 states preempt stricter local e-cigarette regulations in 55 laws. Of 
      these states, 19 preempt advertising regulations, 11 preempt licensure 
      requirements, four preempt ordinances for indoor clean air, and 21 preempt youth 
      access. A broad range of terms was employed to describe preemption, yet few 
      states explicitly used the term "preempt." E-cigarette ceiling preemption laws 
      inhibit public health progress and prevent local authorities from addressing the 
      popularity of e-cigarettes among adolescents.States without preemption laws 
      should be encouraged to adopt language that expressly saves local authority.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe inflammatory disease with high 
      morbidity and mortality in patients and lung transplant recipients. Tumor 
      necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 3 (TIPE3) is one of the members of the 
      TIPE family. While TIPE2 has been demonstrated to be protective against 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI, the role of TIPE3 in ALI is currently 
      unidentified. METHODS: To examine the role of TIPE3 in ALI, we pretreated C57BL/6 
      mice with control or TIPE3-lentivirus in LPS-induced ALI models. The C57BL/6 mice 
      were randomly divided into four groups: control group; ALI-induced group; 
      ALI-induced group with control lentivirus; and ALI-induced group with 
      TIPE3-lentivirus. Additionally, RAW 264.7 cells were used to validate the role 
      and molecular mechanism of TIPE3 signaling in vitro. RESULTS: An increased 
      expression of TIPE3 reduced lung histopathological damage in ALI-affected mice. 
      ALI-affected mice treated with TIPE3-lentivirus exhibited reduced lung 
      microvascular permeability, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, neutrophil buildup, 
      and inflammation response. Additionally, over-expression of TIPE3 significantly 
      inhibited NF-κB activation and promoted the activation of Liver X receptors alpha 
      (LXRα). In LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells, enforced TIPE3 expression produced 
      anti-inflammatory effects, whereas the LXR inhibitor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate 
      (GGPP) reversed these effects. CONCLUSIONS: TIPE3 protected against LPS-induced 
      ALI by regulating the LXRα/NF-κB signaling pathway. These results suggest that 
      TIPE3 might provide a novel insight into the prevention of ALI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) 
      remains the only curative option for high-risk myeloid malignancies. 
      Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) has proven to be effective for graft 
      versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Given that graft-versus-tumor (GVT) 
      effect plays a major role in reducing the risk of disease relapse, the 
      application of PT-Cy must balance the risk of relapse. Mixed chimerism (MC) 
      refers to a state of concurrent presence of recipient and donor cells post 
      allo-HSCT which may precede relapse disease. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the 
      impact of PT-Cy on early MC (EMC) and disease relapse in patients with a myeloid 
      malignancy post allo-HSCT. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective single-center study 
      included patients that underwent allo-HSCT between 2015 and 2021. Patient and 
      disease characteristics were collected from the electronic health records. EMC 
      was defined as <95% donor cells at day 90-120 post allo-HSCT. RESULTS: A total of 
      144 patient that received an allo-HSCT were included in the study. One hundred 
      and eight (75%) patients received PT-Cy as part of the GVHD prophylaxis regimen. 
      The majority underwent allo-HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia (62%) or 
      myelodysplastic syndrome (31%). Sixty-five percent received allo-HSCT from a 
      matched unrelated donor transplant and 65% received a myeloablative conditioning 
      regimen. A lower rate of chronic GVHD (p = 0.03) and a higher rate of EMC 
      (p = 0.04) were observed in patients that received PT-Cy. PT-Cy was not 
      associated with overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). 
      Multivariable analysis identified measurable residual disease status (p = 0.003), 
      hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (p = 0.012) and 
      chronic GVHD (p = 0.006) as independent prognostic variables for OS. AML-adverse 
      risk (p = 0.004) and EMC (p = 0.018) were independently prognostic for RFS. While 
      EMC overall was not significantly associated with higher risk of relapse, EMC was 
      associated with shorter RFS within adverse-risk AML patients. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study shows that PT-Cy was associated with an increased risk of EMC. The 
      predictive value of EMC for relapse remains unclear and may depend on the 
      underlying disease, which should be validated in a larger cohort.

AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective 
      treatment option for hereditary hemoglobin disorders, such as beta-thalassemia; 
      However, this procedure is not without constraints, mainly engendering 
      complications such as acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), chronic GvHD 
      (cGvHD), and susceptibility to infections. The clinical outcomes of allo-HSCT are 
      highly dependant on the quality and quantity of T-cell subsets reconstitution. 
      Following the allo-HSCT of six pediatric patients afflicted with 
      beta-thalassemia, their mononuclear cells were isolated, and then cultured with a 
      combination of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)/ionomycin and Brefeldin A. The 
      content of CD4 T-cell subsets, including T helper 17 (Th17) cells and regulatory 
      T cells (Tregs), were determined by specific conjugated-monoclonal antibodies 
      three and six months post-HSCT. An increased frequency of total CD4 T-cells, 
      Tregs and Th17 cells was observed at day 90 and 180 after allo-HSCT, albeit the 
      numbers were still lower than that of our healthy controls. In patients who 
      developed cGvHD, a lower Th17/Treg ratio was observed, owing it to a decreased 
      proportion of Th17 cells. In conclusion, creating balance between Th17 and Treg 
      subsets may prevent acute and chronic GvHD in patients after allo-HSCT.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anemia in chronic kidney disease is of great concern regarding 
      blood transfusions and the possibility of allosensitization for future kidney 
      transplants and the occurrence of rejection and allograft loss in the 
      post-transplant period. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of early 
      blood transfusion on the occurrence of rejections, allograft function and 
      survival in the first year after transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This 
      retrospective study was carried out with 445 patients submitted to kidney 
      transplant allocated to two groups. The first group received early blood 
      transfusions after transplant (n = 125, 28.09%), and the second group did not 
      receive blood transfusions (n = 320, 71.91%). The patient outcomes were evaluated 
      during a 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: 14 patients given blood transfusion (11.2%) 
      lost their allograft in the first year in comparison with 8 (2.5%) without 
      transfusion (p < 0.001). There were 9 deaths in each group, which corresponded to 
      7.2% of the patients who received blood transfusions and 2.81% of those who did 
      not (p < 0.035). Patient hospitalization lasted 15 days in transfusion group and 
      8.5 days in non-transfusion group (p < 0.001). Creatinine levels were higher in 
      the patients who received blood transfusion than in those without transfusion in 
      the first and third months after transplantation (p = 0.012 and 0.038, 
      respectively). During the first year, the patients who received blood products 
      experienced more antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) (13.60%) than patients who 
      did not (4.38%) (p < 0.001). Those who received blood transfusions also developed 
      de novo DSA in higher proportion than those without transfusion against both 
      class I and class II HLA (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that blood 
      transfusions in the first month after transplantation had a negative impact on 
      kidney function, graft survival, and contributed to the development of de novo 
      DSA, an increased risk of ABMR and infections.

AB  - Irregular growth of cells in the skull is recognized as a brain tumor that can 
      have two types such as benign and malignant. There exist various methods which 
      are used by oncologists to assess the existence of brain tumors such as blood 
      tests or visual assessments. Moreover, the noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) technique without ionizing radiation has been commonly utilized for 
      diagnosis. However, the segmentation in 3-dimensional MRI is time-consuming and 
      the outcomes mainly depend on the operator's experience. Therefore, a novel and 
      robust automated brain tumor detector has been suggested based on segmentation 
      and fusion of features. To improve the localization results, we pre-processed the 
      images using Gaussian Filter (GF), and SynthStrip: a tool for brain skull 
      stripping. We utilized two known benchmarks for training and testing i.e., 
      Figshare and Harvard. The proposed methodology attained 99.8% accuracy, 99.3% 
      recall, 99.4% precision, 99.5% F1 score, and 0.989 AUC. We performed the 
      comparative analysis of our approach with prevailing DL, classical, and 
      segmentation-based approaches. Additionally, we also performed the 
      cross-validation using Harvard dataset attaining 99.3% identification accuracy. 
      The outcomes exhibit that our approach offers significant outcomes than existing 
      methods and outperforms them.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFAT1) is involved in 
      both neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. In this study, we examined the 
      role of NFAT1 in sepsis-induced cognitive impairment in a mouse model. METHODS: 
      Sepsis was established in adult mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Novel 
      object recognition tests on days 14-21 and fear conditioning tests on days 22-23 
      post-surgery showed that CLP impaired both behaviors. BV2 microglia cells exposed 
      to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to examine the effects of short interfering 
      RNA targeting NFAT1 on autophagy and inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: CLP 
      increased the expression of NFAT1 in hippocampal microglia and induced 
      hippocampal autophagy by downregulating p62, upregulating beclin-1 and 
      autophagy-related gene-5, and increasing the ratio of microtubule-associated 
      protein 1 light chain 3-I (LC3-I) to LC3-II. In addition, CLP shifted microglial 
      polarization from M2 to M1 and the production of inflammatory cytokines, similar 
      to the effects of lipopolysaccharide on BV2 microglia cells. Conversely, NFAT1 
      knockdown or the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine attenuated the effects of 
      CLP on autophagy and inflammation in vitro and in vivo, while rapamycin partially 
      reversed the protective effects of NFAT1 inhibition. CONCLUSION: This study 
      suggests that NFAT1 downregulation attenuates sepsis-induced behavioral deficits 
      by inhibiting autophagy, microglia polarization, and neuroinflammation..

AB  - Fats, oil and grease, and their hydrolyzed counterparts-long chain fatty acids 
      (LCFA) make up a large fraction of numerous wastewaters and are challenging to 
      degrade anaerobically, more so, in low temperature anaerobic digestion (LtAD) 
      systems. Herein, we perform a comparative analysis of publicly available Illumina 
      16S rRNA datasets generated from LCFA-degrading anaerobic microbiomes at low 
      temperatures (10 and 20 °C) to comprehend the factors affecting microbial 
      community dynamics. The various factors considered were the inoculum, substrate 
      and operational characteristics, the reactor operation mode and reactor 
      configuration, and the type of nucleic acid sequenced. We found that 
      LCFA-degrading anaerobic microbiomes were differentiated primarily by inoculum 
      characteristics (inoculum source and morphology) in comparison to the other 
      factors tested. Inoculum characteristics prominently shaped the species richness, 
      species evenness and beta-diversity patterns in the microbiomes even after long 
      term operation of continuous reactors up to 150 days, implying the choice of 
      inoculum needs careful consideration. The generalised additive models represented 
      through beta diversity contour plots revealed that psychrophilic bacteria 
      RBG-13-54-9 from family Anaerolineae, and taxa WCHB1-41 and Williamwhitmania were 
      highly abundant in LCFA-fed microbial niches, suggesting their role in anaerobic 
      treatment of LCFAs at low temperatures of 10-20 °C. Overall, we showed that the 
      following bacterial genera: uncultured Propionibacteriaceae, Longilinea, 
      Christensenellaceae R7 group, Lactivibrio, candidatus Caldatribacterium, 
      Aminicenantales, Syntrophus, Syntrophomonas, Smithella, RBG-13-54-9, WCHB1-41, 
      Trichococcus, Proteiniclasticum, SBR1031, Lutibacter and Lentimicrobium have 
      prominent roles in LtAD of LCFA-rich wastewaters at 10-20 °C. This study provides 
      molecular insights of anaerobic LCFA degradation under low temperatures from 
      collated datasets and will aid in improving LtAD systems for treating LCFA-rich 
      wastewaters.

AB  - Lake Urmia, located in northwest Iran, was among the world's largest hypersaline 
      lakes but has now experienced a 7 m decrease in water level, from 1278 m to 1271 
      over 1996 to 2019. There is doubt as to whether the pixel-based analysis (PBA) 
      approach's answer to the lake's drying is a natural process or a result of human 
      intervention. Here, a non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to a 
      21-year record (2000-2020) of satellite data products, i.e., temperature, 
      precipitation, snow cover, and irrigated vegetation cover (IVC). The Google Earth 
      Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform utilized over 10 sub-basins in three 
      provinces surrounding Lake Urmia to obtain and calculate pixel-based monthly and 
      seasonal scales for the products. Canonical correlation analysis was employed in 
      order to understand the correlation between variables and lake water level (LWL). 
      The trend analysis results show significant increases in temperature (from 1 to 
      2 °C during 2000-2020) over May-September, i.e., in 87 %-25 % of the basin. 
      However, precipitation has seen an insignificant decrease (from 3 to 9 mm during 
      2000-2019) in the rainy months (April and May). Snow cover has also decreased 
      and, when compared with precipitation, shows a change in precipitation patterns 
      from snow to rain. IVC has increased significantly in all sub-basins, especially 
      the southern parts of the lake, with the West province making the largest 
      contribution to the development of IVC. According to the PBA, this analysis 
      underpins the very high contribution of IVC to the drying of the lake in more 
      detail, although the contribution of climate change in this matter is also 
      apparent. The development of IVC leads to increased water consumption through 
      evapotranspiration and excess evaporation caused by the storage of water for 
      irrigation. Due to the decreased runoff caused by consumption exceeding the 
      basin's capacity, the lake cannot be fed sufficiently.

AB  - Forward osmosis (FO) has been widely studied as a promising technology in 
      wastewater treatment, but undesirable reverse solute diffusion (RSD) is 
      inevitable in the FO process. The RSD is generally regarded as a negative factor 
      for the FO process, resulting in the loss of draw solute and reduced FO 
      efficiency. Conventional strategies to address RSD focus on reducing the amount 
      of reverse draw solute by fabricating high selective FO membranes and/or 
      selecting the draw solute with low diffusion. However, since RSD is inevitable, 
      doubts have been raised about the strategies to cope with the already occurring 
      reverse draw in the feed solution, and the feasibility to positively utilise the 
      RSD phenomenon to improve the FO process. Herein, we review the state-of-the-art 
      applications of RSD and their benefits such as improving selectivity and 
      maintaining the stability of the feed solution for both independent FO processes 
      and FO integrated processes. We also provide an outlook and discuss important 
      considerations, including membrane fouling, membrane development and draw/feed 
      solution properties, in RSD utilisation for water and wastewater treatment.

AB  - Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in paired 
      ambient and surface air fugacity samples were measured in the Tibetan Plateau 
      (TP) from 2019 to 2022. The air concentrations of previously intentionally 
      produced chemicals like dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and 
      hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) declined. Their soil-air exchange direction ranged 
      from equilibrium to volatilization, suggesting that the TP is acting as a 
      secondary source of most OCPs and PCBs with the pollution alleviation. However, 
      considerably high atmospheric levels of PCB-11, an indicator of unintentionally 
      produced PCBs (UP-PCBs), were recorded in southern TP. Strong episodic LRAT and 
      deposition of PCB-11 events took place mostly in summer. Those events associated 
      with winds from potential sources and less rainfall interception along the air 
      mass transport routes accounted for a significant fraction of overall atmospheric 
      deposition in the TP. Meanwhile, cryoturbation and plowing are suspected to be 
      important factors contributing to the reemission of PCB-11 from surface soil. The 
      high abundance of PCB-11 and strong deposition/evaporation events highlights 
      potential environmental and health risks of UP-POPs in the TP.

TI  - Isotope geochemistry as a natural tag of fish in Patagonian freshwater 
      environments: The invasive Chinook salmon case.

AB  - Patagonian aquatic environments have been invaded since the end of the last 
      century by different species of salmonids. Knowing the natal origin and 
      homing/straying rate of the salmonids in colonised environments is essential to 
      understanding the dispersal mechanisms and developing management plans. In the 
      last two decades, Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha showed the greatest 
      natural dispersal capacity in Patagonia. The main goal of this study was to 
      evaluate the environmental strontium isotope ratio ((87)Sr/(86)Sr) as a potential 
      natural tag to infer the natal origin and ontogenetic habitat use of salmonids in 
      Patagonia, specifically Chinook salmon. (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratio was determined in 
      water samples from 26 sites distributed in 14 Atlantic and Pacific basins in low 
      and high water seasons. Environmental (87)Sr/(86)Sr showed greater spatial than 
      temporal variation, revealing great potential as a tool to infer the natal origin 
      and life history of several migratory fish species in Patagonia. Otolith 
      core-to-edge (87)Sr/(86)Sr profiles were also analysed in 108 Chinook salmon from 
      six basins. A cluster analysis based on the Unweighted Pair Group method (UPGMA) 
      and Euclidean distances without prior classification grouped the sampled rivers 
      into five main groups with significantly different (p < 0.05) isotopic ratios, 
      sometimes integrated basins with different slopes (Atlantic or Pacific). The 
      cluster analysis (UPGMA) based on the natal (87)Sr/(86)Sr period in otolith 
      (~natal origin) showed clear segregation between the Atlantic and Pacific 
      samples. A mismatch between water and otolith natal (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratio was 
      detected in some Atlantic (e.g. De las Vueltas River in Santa Cruz Basin) and 
      Pacific (e.g. Liquiñe Basin) basins and, which could be explained either by 
      straying behaviours or by large geochemical variability between tributaries, 
      within river systems. Our results showed that (87)Sr/(86)Sr is a useful natural 
      tag to trace the life history of migratory fishes in Patagonia, especially for 
      invasive species such as Chinook salmon.

AB  - Acid rain (AR) causes numerous environmental problems and complex negative 
      effects on plants globally. Many studies have previously reported on direct 
      effects of AR or its depositional substances on plant injury and performance. 
      However, few studies have addressed the indirect effects of AR on plants as 
      mediated by soil microorganisms and the abiotic environment of the soil 
      rhizosphere. The indirect effects (e.g., AR → soil microorganisms→plants) need 
      greater attention, because acidic deposition not only affects the distribution, 
      composition, abundance, function, and activity of plant-associated 
      microorganisms, but also influences the dynamics of some substances in the soil 
      in a way that may be harmful to plants. Therefore, this review not only focused 
      on the direct effects of AR on plant performance, growth, and biomass allocations 
      from a whole-plant perspective, but also addressed the pathway of AR-soil 
      chemical characteristics-plants, which explains how soil solute leaching and 
      acidification by AR will reduce the availability of essential nutrients and 
      increase the availability of heavy metals for plants, affecting carbon and 
      nitrogen cycles. Mainly, we evaluated the AR-soil microorganisms-plants pathway 
      by: 1) synthesizing the potential roles of soil microbes in alleviating soil 
      acidic stress on plants and the adverse effects of AR on plant-associated soil 
      microorganisms; 2) exploring how plant mycorrhizal types affect the detection of 
      AR effect on plants. The meta-analysis showed that the effects of AR-induced pH 
      on leaf chlorophyll content, plant height, and plant root biomass were dependent 
      on plant mycorrhizal types. Some possible reasons for different synergy between 
      mycorrhizal symbiotic types and plants were discussed. Future research relating 
      to the effects of AR on plants should focus on the combined direct and indirect 
      effects to evaluate how AR affects plant performance comprehensively.

AB  - The excessive application of antibiotics and surfactants resulted in their 
      massive accumulation in waste activated sludge (WAS), but the co-occurrent 
      impacts of antibiotics and surfactants on the antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) 
      fates have seldom reported. This work mainly revealed the roles and critical 
      mechanisms of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) on the sulfadiazine (SDZ) 
      stressing for ARGs distribution during WAS anaerobic fermentation. 
      High-throughput qPCR and metagenomic analysis revealed that SDBS aggravated the 
      SDZ selective pressure, and accelerated the proliferation of ARGs. The total 
      abundance of ARGs was increased from 8.81 × 10(10) in SDZ to 1.17 × 10(11) 
      copies/g TSS in the SDBS/SDZ co-occurrence system. Specifically, the absolute 
      abundances of ermF (MLSB), mefA (MLSB), tetM-01 (tetracycline), tetX 
      (tetracycline), sul2 (sulfonamide) and strB (aminoglycoside) were risen from 
      4.60 × 10(8)-7.44 × 10(9) copies/g TSS in the SDZ reactor to 
      1.02 × 10(9)-4.63 × 10(10) copies/g TSS in SDBS/SDZ reactor. SDBS was contributed 
      to the SDZ solubilization and simultaneously effective in disintegrating 
      extracellular polymeric substances and improving cell membrane permeability, 
      which would facilitate the SDZ transport and its interactions with ARGs hosts. 
      Consequently, the microbial community structure was evidently altered, and the 
      typical ARGs hosts (i.e., Saccharimonadales and Ahniella) were greatly enriched. 
      Also, the cell signal transduction systems (i.e., glnL, glrK and pilG), oxidative 
      stress response (i.e., frmA and recA) and bacterial secretion systems (i.e., 
      VirB4), which were related with ARGs propagation, were all provoked in the 
      co-occurred SDBS/SDZ reactor compared with that of sole SDZ. PLS-PM analysis 
      suggested that the bacterial community was the predominant factor that determined 
      the ARGs fates, followed by mobile genetic elements and metabolic pathway. This 
      work demonstrated the interactive effects of surfactants and antibiotics on the 
      ARGs fates in WAS fermentation systems and gave insightful implications on the 
      ecological risks of different exogenous pollutants.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that juvenile or adult exposure to polychlorinated 
      biphenyls (PCBs) induces alterations in reproductive functions (e.g., reduced 
      fertilization rate) and behavior (e.g., reduced nest maintenance) in fish. 
      Embryonic exposures to other endocrine disrupting chemicals have been reported to 
      induce long-term reproductive toxicity in fish. However, the effects of embryonic 
      exposure to PCBs or their metabolites, OH-PCBs, on long-term reproductive 
      function in fish are unknown. In the present study, we used the marine medaka 
      fish (Oryzias melastigma) as a model to assess the reproductive endpoints in 
      response to embryonic exposure to either PCB 28 or 4'-OH-PCB 65. Our results 
      showed that the sex ratio of marine medaka was feminized by exposure to 4'-OH-PCB 
      65. Fecundity was decreased in the medaka treated with either PCB 28 or 4'-OH-PCB 
      65, whereas the medaka from embryonic exposure to 4'-OH-PCB 65 additionally 
      exhibited reduced fertilization and a reduction in the hatching success rate of 
      offspring, as well as decreased sperm motility. Serum 11-KT concentrations were 
      reduced in the PCB 28-treated medaka, and serum estradiol (E2)/testosterone (T) 
      and E2/11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) ratios were decreased in the 4'-OH-PCB 
      65-treated medaka. To explain these observations at the molecular level, 
      transcriptomic analysis of the gonads was performed. Bioinformatic analysis using 
      Gene Ontology and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that genes involved in 
      various pathways potentially involved in reproductive functions (e.g., steroid 
      metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis) were differentially expressed in the 
      testes and ovaries of either PCB- or OH-PCB-treated medaka. Thus, the long-term 
      reproductive toxicity in fish due to embryonic exposure to PCB or OH-PCB should 
      be considered for environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Massive sewage sludge (SS) production from municipal wastewater treatment plants 
      and the presence of numerous pollutant types render the process of SS treatment 
      and disposal costly and complex. Here, resource recovery from SS was maximised 
      via the optimisation of sludge-based activated carbon (SBAC) production for the 
      removal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), while considering 
      economic factors and minimising environmental impacts. SBAC production 
      optimisation was realised under different operating conditions (different ZnCl(2) 
      impregnation ratios and different pyrolysis activation temperatures and 
      durations). The sorption capacity of the optimised SBAC with respect to the 
      removal of nine commonly detected PFASs, with environmentally relevant 
      concentrations (∽50 μg/L), from simulated wastewater was evaluated. Economic 
      analysis and life-cycle assessment (LCA) were also performed to determine the 
      feasibility of the process and its potential role in the circular economy. Batch 
      adsorption tests confirmed the high efficiency of the optimised SBACs for PFAS 
      removal (93-100 %), highlighting the possibility of converting SS to SBAC. 
      Economically speaking, the optimised SBAC at 1.5 M ZnCl(2), 500 °C, and 0.75 h 
      reduced total production cost by 49 %. Further, the cost could be reduced to as 
      little as 1087 US $/metric-ton compared with that corresponding to the original 
      conditions (2.5 M ZnCl(2), 500 °C, 2 h; 2144 US $/metric-ton). LCA results also 
      showed that freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, and human 
      non-carcinogenic toxicity were the most affected environmental impact indicators, 
      showing a 49 % decrease when ZnCl(2) impregnation ratio was reduced from 2.5 to 
      1.5 M. These findings highlighted the optimal conditions for the production of 
      SBAC with high sorption capacity at a reduced cost and with reduced environmental 
      impacts. Thus, they can serve as valuable tools for decision making regarding the 
      selection of the most sustainable and economically feasible process for PFAS 
      removal.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds are ubiquitous in the environment, which may cause 
      various adverse health effects. The objectives of this study were to investigate 
      associations of single and mixture of urinary metabolites of volatile organic 
      compounds (mVOCs) with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk, and examine the 
      possible role of oxidative stress in the associations. This nested case-control 
      study included 454 GDM cases and 454 healthy controls matched by maternal age and 
      infant sex. Urinary concentrations of twenty-one mVOCs and three oxidative stress 
      biomarkers (including 8-OHdG, 8-OHG, and HNEMA), in early pregnancy were 
      measured. Analyses using logistic regression model showed that an interquartile 
      range increase in urinary concentrations of six individual mVOCs (ATCA, BPMA, 
      CEMA, 3HPMA, MU, and TGA) were significantly associated with increased odds of 
      GDM by 19-27%. Weighted quantile sum regression analyses showed that in each 
      quartile increment of the mixture of mVOCs, the odds of GDM increased by 39% (95% 
      CI: 16%, 67%), with 2-aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid weighted the most in the 
      associations (weight: 25%). Furthermore, significant associations of the 
      oxidative stress biomarkers with both GDM and certain mVOCs were observed. These 
      results suggested that certain urinary mVOCs (correspondingly, the parent VOCs 
      such as 1-bromopropane, cyanide, and benzene should be concerned as priority ones 
      for regulation and policy making) in early pregnancy were significantly 
      associated with elevated GDM incidence, and the associations were potentially 
      related with oxidative stress biomarkers.

AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) includes the analysis of human metabolic 
      biomarkers of xenobiotics in influent wastewater. WBE complements existing drug 
      utilization approaches and provides objective, spatio-temporal information on the 
      consumption of pharmaceuticals in the general population. This approach was 
      applied to 24-h composite influent wastewater samples from Leuven, Belgium. Daily 
      samples were analysed from September 2019 to December 2019 (n = 76), and on three 
      days of the week (Monday, Wednesday, Saturday) from January 2020 to April 2022 
      (n = 367). Sample analysis consisted of 96-well solid-phase extraction and liquid 
      chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Measured concentrations of 21 
      biomarkers for antidepressant and opioid use were converted to 
      population-normalized mass loads (PNML) by considering the flow rate and 
      catchment population. To capture population movements, mobile phone data was 
      used. Amitriptyline, hydroxy-bupropion, norcitalopram, citalopram, 
      normirtazapine, trazodone, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, codeine, 
      2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), methadone, morphine, 
      O-desmethyltramadol, and tramadol were included in the temporal assessment since 
      concentrations were above the lower limit of quantification. The PNML of most 
      biomarkers increased (with 3-119 %) throughout the sampling period. The 
      population disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a major change in the 
      socio-demographics of the catchment area, resulting in temporal differences in 
      the PNML of the different biomarkers. As such, higher PNML were observed during 
      the different lockdown phases, which were characterized by the outflow of 
      university students and a decreasing commuting in and out the catchment area. The 
      effects of the fluctuating socio-demographics of the catchment population were 
      further evidenced by the different week-weekend pattern of PNMLs over the course 
      of the sampling campaign. Mean parent/metabolite ratios (i.e., 
      citalopram/norcitalopram, tramadol/O-desmethyltramadol, 
      venlafaxine/O-desmethylvenlafaxine, and methadone/EDDP) remained relatively 
      stable throughout the entire sampling campaign (RSD% below 25 % for all ratios, 
      except for methadone/EDDP) and therefore were not affected by this population 
      change.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous worldwide, present even in remote areas of the 
      natural environment. Hiking and trail running are a source of MPs on recreational 
      trails in protected environments, which are characterised by high biodiversity 
      and natural, ecological or cultural significance. Our understanding of the risks 
      of microplastic pollution is impeded however by a lack of information on MPs 
      present in the soil environment in such areas. This study characterised the 
      quantity and physicochemical characteristics of MPs in two conservation areas in 
      south-eastern Australia: 1) the adjacent Duval Nature Reserve and Dumaresq Dam 
      Reserve, and 2) the Washpool and Gibraltar Range National Parks. We measured 
      atmospheric deposition over a six-month period in the Reserves, and baseline 
      amounts of MPs on recreational trails in the Reserves and National Parks. 
      Atmospheric deposition averaged 17.4 MPs m(-2) day(-1) and was dominated by 
      fibres, comprising 84 % of MPs. Microplastics detected on trail surfaces ranged 
      from 162.5 ± 41.6 MPs/linear metre to 168.7 ± 18.5 MPs/linear metre and exhibited 
      a very wide range of physical and chemical characteristics. The majority of MPs 
      on the trail surfaces comprised polyurethane, polyethylene terephthalate and 
      polystyrene, and 47-71 % were fibres. Microplastics were attributed to clothing, 
      footwear, litter, and diffuse sources. Minimising and preventing MP pollution, 
      however, is complex given there are multiple direct and diffuse sources, and 
      several factors influencing increased MP deposition and retention in the 
      environment.

TI  - Response of Chinese pine regeneration density to forest gap and slope aspect in 
      northern China: A meta-analysis.

AB  - Chinese pine is a Chinese endemic species with important ecological functions. 
      Forest gaps and slope aspect are important factors in the regeneration of Chinese 
      pine by influencing light and moisture, but what these effects are is still up 
      for debate. Meanwhile, the effects of forest gaps and slope aspect are poorly 
      studied in response to different forest types and ages, as well as temperature 
      and precipitation. We established literature selection criteria that finally 
      identified 101 and 69 pairs of study cases on forest gaps and slope aspect, 
      respectively. The overall effect values were obtained by meta-analysis and found 
      that gap and shady slope habitats had significant positive effects on the 
      regeneration density of Chinese pine (P < 0.05). The gap most enhanced the 
      regeneration density in a plantation setting (P < 0.05). In pure stands of 
      Chinese pine, shady slopes can significantly increase regeneration density 
      (P < 0.05). Forest gaps and shady slopes contributed most to Chinese pine 
      regeneration density in mature stands compared to near mature stands, and over 
      mature stands (P < 0.05). There was no significant effect of stand gap size on 
      regeneration density (P > 0.05). In particular, the edges of the gap appeared to 
      be well-suited for regeneration (P < 0.05). In our study area, mean annual 
      precipitation resulted in a significant increase in the effects of the gap and 
      shady slope as precipitation declined (P < 0.05). This meta-analysis helps 
      elucidate the effects of forest gap (position or area) and slope aspect on 
      Chinese pine regeneration. With global climate change, Chinese pine regeneration 
      may prefer the edge of forest gaps and shady slopes.

AB  - Mechanisms underlying the plant uptake, accumulation, and translocation of 
      organophosphate esters (OPEs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in field 
      environments remain ambiguous. To better understand these processes, we selected 
      a typically polluted river with steady flow and rampant water hyacinth 
      (Eichhornia crassipes) and investigated 25 OPEs and 23 BFRs in 24 sets of matched 
      water-plant samples. Both OPEs and BFRs showed high or ultra-high levels in field 
      water hyacinths, statistically positive water-plant/root concentration 
      correlations, and dominant distributions in the roots. Passive root uptake was 
      the dominant route for OPEs and BFRs to enter the water hyacinth. Both OPEs and 
      BFRs in water hyacinth exhibited acropetal translocation from the root and 
      possible basipetal translocation from the leaf. The accumulation and 
      translocation of OPEs in water hyacinth were significantly affected by their 
      substituents and structures, including the chlorination degree, alkyl chain 
      length, side chain, and methylation degree of aryl-substituted OPEs. The 
      translocation of BFRs in water hyacinth also showed close association with their 
      bromination degree, but their accumulation in roots showed anomaly, indicating 
      possible transformations. Overall, the enrichment and behavior of OPEs and BFRs 
      in water hyacinth seemed to be mainly controlled by physicochemical parameters. 
      OPE/BFR concentrations in total suspended particulate (TSP), TSP-associated 
      organic carbon content, TSP concentration, and plant biomass all showed 
      significant effects on their root accumulation and translocations in water 
      hyacinth. This study provides rare field evidences and novel insights into the 
      basipetal translocation of OPEs and BFRs in plants.

AB  - Addition of organic amendments, such as manure and straw, to arable fields as a 
      partial substitute for mineral phosphorus (P), are a sustainable practice in 
      high-efficiency agricultural production. Different organic inputs may induce 
      varied soil organic carbon (OC) stability and phoD harboring microbes, 
      subsequently regulate P behavior, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly 
      understood. A 11-year field experiment examined P forms by (31)P-nuclear magnetic 
      resonance (NMR), OC chemical composition by (13)C NMR, and biologically-based P 
      availability methods, phoD bacterial communities, and their co-occurrence in 
      soils amended with chemical P fertilizer (CF), chemical P partly substituted by 
      organic amendments including pig manure (CM), a mixture of pig manure and corn 
      straw (CMS), and corn straw (CS), with equal P input in all treatments. Organic 
      amendments significantly increased soil labile P(i) (CaCl(2)-P, citrate-P, 
      2.91-3.26 and 1.16-1.32 times higher than CF) and P(o) (enzyme-P, diesters, 
      4.08-7.47 and 1.71-2.14 times higher than CF) contents and phosphatase 
      activities, while significantly decreased aromaticity (AI) and recalcitrance 
      indexes (RI) of soil C, compared with CF. The keystone genera in manured soils 
      (Alienimomas and Streptomyces) and straw-applied soils (Janthinobacterium and 
      Caulobacter) were significantly correlated with soil enzyme-P, microbial biomass 
      P (MBP), diesters, and citrate-P. Soil AI and RI were significantly correlated 
      with the phoD keystone and soil P species. It suggested that the keystone was 
      impacted by soil OC stability and play a role in regulating P redistribution in 
      amended soils. This study highlights how manure and straw incorporation altered 
      soil OC stability, shaped the phoD harboring community, and enhanced soil P 
      biological processes promoted by the keystone taxa. The partial substitution of 
      mineral P by mixture of manure and straw is effectively promote soil P 
      availability and beneficial for environmental sustainability.

AB  - The genus Carpobrotus N.E.Br. comprises several aggressive invasive species that 
      threaten biodiversity in coastal areas worldwide. We studied the phenotypic 
      plasticity of Carpobrotus sp. pl. invading four coastal habitats in the 
      north-western Iberian Peninsula (coastal cliffs, disturbed areas, dunes and 
      coastal forests). We measured morphological traits and carbon (δ(13)C) and 
      nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable isotope ratios of Carpobrotus sp. pl. individuals 
      collected in each habitat. Our results indicated that leaf carbon content (% C) 
      and dry shoot weight were higher on cliffs and lower in mixed forests. In 
      contrast, leaf water content was higher in mixed forests and lower on cliffs. 
      Leaf nitrogen content (% N) was higher in forests, which might be due to the 
      presence of Acacia longifolia, an alien tree that accumulates N in the soil 
      through symbiotic associations with N fixing bacteria. Differences in δ(15)N 
      showed the use of different N sources in each habitat. Values were higher in 
      disturbed areas with greater human activity and lower on cliffs and forests. 
      δ(13)C was higher in cliffs and dunes, suggesting CAM activity where drought and 
      salinity are more intense. Water use efficiency (iWUE) and δ(13)C were higher on 
      cliffs and dunes, suggesting an adaptation and high tolerance of Carpobrotus sp. 
      pl. to unfavourable conditions such as drought or salinity in the invaded areas.

AB  - Human activities have changed the levels and ratios of nitrogen (N) and 
      phosphorus (P) in wetland ecosystems. However, the effects of N and P levels and 
      ratios on wetland soil microbial community and ecosystem multifunctionality 
      remain unclear, especially on the relationships between soil microbial diversity 
      and ecosystem multifunctionality. In this study, the effects of a 7-year 
      experimental nutrient addition on the soil microbial community and ecosystem 
      multifunctionality (12 function variables related to carbon, N, and P cycling) 
      were assessed by combining three N and P supply levels with three N:P supply 
      ratios in a coastal nontidal wetland ecosystem. According to the obtained 
      results, the N and P supply levels significantly affected soil bacterial 
      community composition, as well as ecosystem multifunctionality, while no 
      significant effects of N:P supply ratios were observed. Although N and P supply 
      levels did not significantly affect bacterial and fungal diversity, they both 
      changed the complexity of bacterial and fungal networks. Soil ecosystem 
      multifunctionality was significantly and positively correlated with bacterial 
      diversity rather than fungal diversity. Moreover, the correlation coefficient 
      between bacterial diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality showed an 
      increasing-decreasing trend with increasing N and P supply levels and an 
      increasing trend with increasing N:P supply ratios. However, the correlation 
      coefficient between bacterial diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality was not 
      significantly correlated with bacterial network complexity. The current study 
      provides new insights into the impacts of N and P levels and ratios on soil 
      microbial community and ecosystem multifunctionality in a coastal nontidal 
      wetland. In particular, the present study highlighted that changes in N and P 
      supply levels and ratios lead to changes in the relationship between soil 
      bacterial diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality, which should be considered 
      in related studies to accurately predict the responses of ecosystem 
      multifunctionality to N and P inputs in coastal nontidal wetlands.

AB  - Leachate generated during the treatment and disposal of municipal solid wastes 
      (MSWs) can be an important source of pharmaceutical and personal care products 
      (PPCPs) in the environment. With the implementation of garbage classification 
      policy in China, the disposal methods of MSWs have changed, while its impacts on 
      the occurrence of PPCPs in the generated leachate remain unknown. In this study, 
      we investigated 49 target PPCPs in the leachates of classified MSWs, i.e. 
      residual waste leachate (RWL) and food waste leachate (FWL), and revealed the 
      influence of garbage classification implementation on the occurrence of PPCPs in 
      leachates to be treated. The results showed the concentration and mass load of 
      target PPCPs in the RWL samples (median values: 34.9 ng/L and 52.3 mg/d, 
      respectively) were significantly higher than those in the FWL samples (median 
      values: 19.3 ng/L and 14.5 mg/d, respectively). Macrolide (ML) antibiotics were 
      the predominant PPCPs in the RWL samples, while in the FWL samples, quinolone 
      (QL) antibiotics exhibited the highest concentration and mass load. The 
      implementation of garbage classification policy led to the reduction of PPCP mass 
      load (from 739 g/d to 262 g/d) in leachates to be treated. The findings are 
      helpful for better designing or managing MSW treatment and disposal processes to 
      minimize the emission of PPCPs from MSW leachates.

AB  - The indigenous microalga Chlorella sorokiniana NBU-3 grown under air, 5 %, 15 %, 
      and 25 % CO(2) supply was evaluated to determine its potential for flue gas 
      bio-capture, nutrient removal capacity and biomass yield using non-sterilized 
      wastewater as growth medium. The results indicated that C. sorokiniana NBU-3 
      exhibited high nutrient removal efficiency (>95 % for NH(4)(+)-N, TN and TP) with 
      either air or CO(2) aeration. 5 %-15 % CO(2) supplies promote biomass yield, 
      nutrient utilization and CO(2) biofixation of C. sorokiniana NBU-3. In 
      particular, 15 % CO(2) promotes C. sorokiniana NBU-3 growth in non-sterilized MW, 
      but inhibits its growth in BG11 medium, indicating the importance of 
      non-sterilized MW and high CO(2) aeration concurrence for C. sorokiniana NBU-3 
      economically practical cultivation. Moreover, the highest values of lipid 
      (27.84 ± 2.12 %) and protein (32.65 ± 4.11 %) contents were obtained in MW with 
      15 % CO(2) aeration. Conceivably, microalgal-bacterial symbiosis may help C. 
      sorokiniana NBU-3 tolerate high concentration of CO(2) and promote microalga 
      growth. The succession of the community diversity toward the specific functional 
      bacterial species such as Methylobacillus and Methylophilus (Proteobacteria) 
      which were predicted to possess the function of methylotroph, methanol oxidation 
      and ureolysis would help facilitate the microalgal-bacterial symbiosis and 
      promote the microalgae biomass accumulation with high dosage of CO(2) aeration. 
      Overall, these findings clearly highlight the potential of this indigenous 
      microalga C. sorokiniana NBU-3 for industrial-emission level CO(2) mitigation and 
      commercial microalga biomass production in MW.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in agricultural soils, but to what extent and 
      how environmental factors determine the source and fate of MPs in agricultural 
      soils is not clear. In this study, Hainan Island, which has different climatic 
      conditions, altitudes, and land uses across the island, was selected to 
      investigate the MPs abundance and the shape, size, color, and polymer type of the 
      MPs in agricultural soils. The main focus was on the role of land use type and 
      the identification of environmental influencing factors. The results showed that 
      MPs were detected in all the soil samples across the island, with an abundance 
      range of 20 to 6790 items kg(-1) and an average of 417 items kg(-1). Fragments 
      (46.8 %), MPs smaller than 0.5 mm (37.8 %), black MPs (48.3 %), and polypropylene 
      MPs (56.8 %) were observed as the dominant MPs species. Significantly higher MPs 
      abundance was found in mulched arable land, and higher contents of fibers and 
      fragments were observed in woodland and paddy lands, respectively. With 
      correlation and redundancy analyses, soil pH, soil organic matter content, and 
      average annual temperature were found to be the main factors influencing the 
      biotic/abiotic fragmentation of MPs. The regional population density, including 
      tourism represented by the night light index, affects the input process of MPs. 
      MPs transport and deposition were found to be affected by altitude, annual 
      precipitation, and soil moisture content. This study represents the first 
      large-scale study of MPs contamination in island agricultural soils and provides 
      important data on the distribution, transport, and fate of MPs.

AB  - The complication of stent implantation is the biggest obstacle to the success of 
      its clinical application. In this study, we developed a combination way of 3D 
      printing and the coating technique for preparation of functional polyurethane 
      stents against stent implantation-induced thrombosis and postoperative infection. 
      SEM, XPS, static water contact angle, and XRD demonstrated that the functional 
      polyurethane stent had a 37 μm-thickness membrane composed of zein nanospheres 
      (250-350 nm). Meanwhile, ZnO nanoparticles were encapsulated in zein nanospheres 
      while heparin was adsorbed on the surface, causing 97.1 ± 6.4 % release of 
      heparin in 120 min (first-order kinetic model) and 62.7 ± 5.6 % release of Zn(2+) 
      in 9 days (Korsmeyer-Peppas model). The mechanical analysis revealed that the 
      functional polyurethane stents had about 8.61 MPa and 2.5 MPa tensile strength 
      and bending strength, respectively. The in vitro biological analysis showed that 
      the functional polyurethane stents had good EA.hy926 cells compatibility 
      (97.9 ± 3.8 %), anti-coagulation response (comparable plasma protein, platelet 
      adhesion and suppressed clotting) and sustained antibacterial activities by 
      comparison with the bare polyurethane stent. The preliminary evaluation by rabbit 
      ex vivo carotid artery intervention experiment demonstrated that the functional 
      polyurethane stents could maintain blood circulation under the continuous 
      stresses of blood flow. Meanwhile, the detailed data from the simulated implant 
      infection experiment in vivo showed the functional polyurethane stents could 
      effectively reduce microbial infection by 3-6 times lower and improve fibrosis 
      and macrophage infiltration.

AB  - Lignin is often considered to be a complex polymeric structural material with 
      excellent scalability. Reduced pressure distillation, a novel effective way, was 
      proposed to recover reusable waste lignin from textile degumming black liquor. 
      The structure of the recovered material was determined by Fourier Transform 
      Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Klason 
      Component Analysis. Recycled lignin (RL) was used as the basis for the synthesis 
      of a cationic recycled lignin-based polymers (CRLM) through graft polymerizing 
      cationic monomer (DMC). The optimum synthesis conditions were obtained by 
      conducting orthogonal experiments using the cationicity as the studied parameter, 
      while selecting pH, DMC/RL, reaction temperature and time as independent 
      variables. Recovery experiments showed that the maximum recovery concentration of 
      RL in the black liquor was 5 g/L, with a purity of approximately 83 %. Orthogonal 
      experiments showed that a low DMC/RL ratio was crucial for the synthesis of 
      flocculants. When the molar ratio of DMC/RL was 3:1, the cationicity of the 
      prepared CRLM was as high as 11.32 %. Zeta potential and decolorization 
      experiments also confirmed the stable decolorization performance of CRLM in three 
      kinds of anionic dye wastewater. The experimental results showed that charge 
      neutralization, chemical bonding forces and auxiliary effects play great role to 
      remove anionic dyes, resulting in 94 %, 89 % and 94.9 % removal against Reactive 
      Red 195 (RR195), Acid Red 18 (AR18) and Direct 168 (DB168) respectively. 
      Therefore, this study demonstrated the potential of using recycled waste lignin 
      as synthesize lignin-based flocculants in the field of printing and dyeing 
      wastewater by treating waste with waste.

AB  - It is well known that nitrogen (N) fertilizer input is required to improve crop 
      productivity, but we lack a comprehensive understanding of how elevated N input 
      changes the formation of soil acid hydrolyzable nitrogen (AHN) by adjusting the 
      most vital microbial taxa of keystone species of microbial communities and enzyme 
      activities. A 15-year field experiment comprising four levels of inorganic N 
      fertilization was conducted to identify the most important bacterial and fungal 
      taxa of the keystone species derived from cooccurrence networks as well as the 
      vital enzyme activities at the bell mouth and maturity stages. Long-term N 
      fertilization significantly increased the levels of AHN along with its four 
      fractions, including amino acid N (AAN), ammonium N (AN), amino sugar N (ASN), 
      and hydrolysable unidentified N (HUN), by 30.1-118.6 %, regardless of growth 
      stage. Some most vital microbial taxa of keystone species and enzyme activities, 
      which changed in response to N fertilization, mainly regulated each ANH fraction, 
      that is, AHN and AN were mainly controlled by the enrichment of Nocardioides and 
      β-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), as well as by the reduction of Anaerolinea 
      and urease (UR), AAN was determined by the enrichment of Hannaella and depletion 
      of Penicillium, ASN was regulated by the enrichment of Hannaella and 
      Arthrobacter, and HUN was influenced by the reduction of Penicillium and 
      enrichment of Nitrosospira. These microbial genera have been found to be involved 
      in dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and 
      nitrification/denitrification processes and the two enzyme activities involved in 
      organic N degradation and N-releasing processes, suggesting that the formation of 
      AHN fractions was closely associated with specific functional microbial taxa and 
      enzyme activities induced by N fertilization. Our results provide new insights 
      into the associations among increased N input, altered formation of soil organic 
      N, and shifts in microbial communities and enzyme activities.

AB  - Weeds reduce vineyard productivity and affect grape quality by competing with 
      grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) for water and nutrients. The increased banning of 
      herbicides has prompted the evaluation of alternative soil management strategies. 
      Cover cropping seems to be the best alternative for weed management. However, it 
      may impact vine growth, grape yield, and quality. Quantitative studies on these 
      changes are scarce. Our study aimed to investigate the combined effect of grass 
      cover and water availability on vines of three cultivars, the white Chasselas and 
      Petite Arvine and the red Pinot noir field-grown under identical climatic and 
      pedological conditions and grafted onto the same rootstock. Soil management and 
      irrigation experiments were performed during the 2020-2021 seasons. Two extreme 
      soil management practices were established in the vineyard, based on 100 % bare 
      soil (BS) by the application of herbicides with glufosinate or glyphosate as 
      active ingredients and 100 % grass-covered soil (GS) by cover cropping with a 
      mixture of plant species. Two water statuses were imposed by drip irrigation (DI) 
      and no irrigation (NI). The level of vine-weed competition for water and nitrogen 
      (N) was assessed in the vine, must, and wine solid residues (WSRs) by comparing 
      measurements, i.e., the yeast assimilable N content, C/N(WSR), carbon and N 
      isotope ratios (δ(13)C(grape-sugars), δ(13)C(WSR), and δ(15)N(WSR)) among the 
      different treatments (BS-DI, BS-NI, GS-DI, GS-NI). The increase in the 
      δ(13)C(grape-sugars) and δ(13)C(WSR) values with increasing plant water deficit 
      mimicked the observations in irrigation experiments on BS. The N(WSR) content and 
      δ(15)N(WSR) values decreased with water stress and much more strongly in vines on 
      GS. The dramatic N deficit in rainfed vines on GS could be alleviated with 
      irrigation. The present study provides insights from chemical and stable isotope 
      analyses into the potential impact of cover cropping in vineyards in the context 
      of the banning of herbicides in a time of global water scarcity due to climate 
      change.

AB  - Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of anthropogenic 
      chemicals, which are not (fully) biodegradable and accumulate in different 
      environmental compartments worldwide. A comprehensive, quantitative analysis - 
      consisting of target analysis (66 different analytes, including e. g. 
      ultrashort-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), precursor compounds and 
      novel substitutes) and the Total Oxidisable Precursor (TOP) assay (including 
      trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)) - were conducted to analyse the PFAS concentrations 
      and patterns in 12 mammalian and two bird species from different areas of Germany 
      and Denmark. The PFAS contamination was investigated in dependance of the trophic 
      class (herbivores, omnivores, carnivores), ecological habitat (terrestrial; 
      (semi-) aquatic) and body tissue (liver, musculature). PFAS concentrations were 
      highest in carnivores, followed by omnivores and herbivores, with ∑PFAS 
      concentration ranging from 1274 μg/kg (Eurasian otter liver) to 22 μg/kg (roe 
      deer liver). TFA dominated in the herbivorous species, whereas 
      perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and the long-chain PFCAs covered the majority 
      of the PFAS contamination in carnivorous species. Besides trophic class, 
      ecological habitat also affected the PFAS levels in the different species, with 
      terrestrial herbivores and omnivores showing higher PFAS concentration than their 
      aquatic counterparts, whereas for carnivores this relationship was reversed. The 
      TOP assay analysis indicated similar trends, with the PFCA formation pattern 
      differing significantly between the trophic classes. TFA was formed predominantly 
      in herbivorous and omnivorous species, whereas in carnivorous species a broad 
      spectrum of PFCAs (chain-length C2-C14) was formed. Musculature tissue of six 
      species exhibited significantly lower PFAS concentrations than the respective 
      liver tissue, but with similar PFAS patterns. The comprehensive approach applied 
      in the present study showed, that primarily the trophic class is decisive for the 
      PFAS concentration, as herbivores, omnivores and carnivores clearly differed in 
      their PFAS concentrations and patterns. Additionally, the TOP assay gave novel 
      insights in the PFCA formation potential in biota samples.

AB  - As a high-performance liquid rocket fuel, unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) 
      will produce wastewater during transportation, storage and cleaning containers. 
      The wastewater will have a bad impact on human health and ecological environment, 
      and it must be properly handled. There are many reports about the technical 
      feasibility of UDMH wastewater treatment. Less attention is paid to analyzing the 
      impact on the environment during the treatment process. This paper quantifies the 
      environmental impacts and economic benefits of four advanced oxidation processes 
      for the treatment of UDMH wastewater based on life cycle assessment and life 
      cycle costing methods. Taking the UDMH wastewater produced by an aerospace group 
      of Tianjin, China as the research object, using Fenton method, UV-Fenton method, 
      electro catalytic oxidation (EC) with ruthenium iridium titanium 
      (Ti/TiO(2)-RuO(2)-IrO(2)) as electrode and electro catalytic oxidation with 
      boron-doped diamond (BDD) as electrode as treatment methods, on the basis of the 
      laboratory test, the industrialized device is adopted. The resource consumption, 
      energy consumption, pollutant discharge and cost were compared when the TOC 
      removal rate was the same, and a better method of treating unsymmetrical dimethyl 
      hydrazine wastewater was discussed. The results show that the impact on most 
      types of environments is as follows: UV-Fenton < Fenton < EC (BDD) < EC 
      (Ti/TiO(2)-RuO(2)-IrO(2)), and the four advanced oxidation methods are all 
      beneficial to reduce eutrophication. The life cycle cost of UV-Fenton is the 
      lowest (US$1.53/m(3)). Combined with environmental and economic analysis, it can 
      be seen that UV-Fenton is the best choice. Through sensitivity analysis, it can 
      be seen that reducing chemical reagents and electricity consumption, and changing 
      the way of generating electricity to renewable energy can significantly reduce 
      the environmental and economic impact. The life cycle cost of EC(BDD) as the 
      electrode is the highest (US$26.20/m(3)), but it can achieve a TOC removal rate 
      of 97.75 %, so it is a better choice when only the removal rate is required 
      regardless of cost.

AB  - Hg(2+) poses a great threat to human health and the environment due to its 
      bioaccumulation and permanent damage. Herein, a reversible CHEF-based 
      near-infrared fluorescent probe 2-(3-((E)-4-((E)-4-(diethylamino)-2- 
      hydroxybenzylidene)amino)styryl)-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile 
      (DHEY) capable of specifically recognizing Hg(2+) was constructed. DHEY exhibits 
      advantages of large Stokes shift (157 nm), excellent selectivity, high 
      sensitivity (LOD = 3.2 μg/L), and fast response efficiency (<3 min). 
      Interestingly, DHEY can also realize rapid and effective detection of Hg(2+) 
      after being recycled 7 times. The successful recovery of trace Hg(2+) in 
      different environmental water samples fully demonstrates the potential of DHEY 
      for actual applications. In particular, DHEY enables real-time observation of the 
      distribution and translocation pattern of exogenous Hg(2+) in HeLa cells and 
      zebrafish. This work provides important theoretical support for investigating the 
      fate of heavy metal ions in the environment using fluorescence techniques.

AB  - Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) play an important role in natural nitrogen cycle, 
      but are difficult to be enriched in wastewater treatment systems. In this 
      experiment, under ambient temperature and high dissolved oxygen, different types 
      of acyl-homoserine lactones (C(6)-HSL, C(8)-HSL, C(10)-HSL, C(14)-HSL and 
      3-oxo-C(14)-HSL) were added to five wastewater nitrification systems to achieve 
      AOA enrichment. Results showed that AOA couldn't be detected in the blank group 
      without the addition of signaling molecules, while the AOA could be detected in 
      all the reactors with the addition. The enrichment effect of AOA was not obvious 
      with added 100 or 200 nmol/L signaling molecules, while the enrichment effect was 
      both obvious with added C(8)-HSL of 400 nmol/L and C(10)-HSL of 800 nmol/L. And 
      relative abundance of AOA increased from undetected in the control group to 
      1.10 % and 0.96 %, respectively. The exogenous signaling molecules may provide 
      new view for AOA enrichment in wastewater treatment systems.

AB  - Large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) is a coastal-dwelling soniferous, 
      commercially important fish species that is sensitive to sound. An understanding 
      of how ocean acidification might affect its auditory system is therefore 
      important for its long-term viability and management as a fisheries resource. We 
      tested the effects of ocean acidification with four CO(2) treatments (440 ppm 
      (control), 1000 ppm, 1800 ppm, and 3000 ppm) on the inner ear system of this 
      species. After exposure to acidified water for 50 d, the impacts on the perimeter 
      and mass of the sagitta, asteriscus, and lapillus otoliths were determined. In 
      the acidified water treatments, the shape of sagittal otoliths became more 
      irregular, and the surface became rougher. Similar sound frequency ranges 
      triggered startle responses of fish in all treatments. In the highest CO(2) 
      treatment (3000 ppm CO(2)), significant asymmetry of the left and right lapillus 
      perimeter and weight was apparent. Moreover, in the higher CO(2) treatments 
      (1800 ppm and 3000 ppm CO(2)), the fish were unable to maintain a balanced 
      dorsal-up posture and tilted to one side. This result suggested that the balance 
      functions of the inner ear might be affected by ocean acidification, which may 
      threaten large yellow croaker individuals and populations. The molecular response 
      to acidification was analyzed by RNA-Seq. The differentially expressed genes 
      (DEGs) between right and left sensory epithelia of the utricle in each CO(2) 
      treatment group were identified. In higher CO(2) concentration groups, nervous 
      system function and regulation of bone mineralization pathways were enriched with 
      DEGs. The comparative transcriptome analyses provide valuable molecular 
      information about how the inner ear system responds to an acidified environment.

AB  - For eutrophic water bodies, potassium permanganate is an effective pre-oxidant to 
      remove algae and its residue in water treatment sludge. Recycling water treatment 
      sludge in concrete is an environmentally friendly and high-value utilization 
      measure. However, little research has been done on the effect of manganese-rich 
      drinking water sludge ash (DWSA) on concrete. The effect of water-binder ratio 
      (w/b) on strength, shrinkage and microstructural characteristics of concrete 
      containing DWSA was investigated, and the structural behavior was explained from 
      a nanoscale perspective. The results show that recycling 10 % DWSA in concrete 
      improved the strength and shrinkage resistance of the samples. Reducing the w/b 
      effectively increased the strength of DWSA-modified concrete and reduced the 
      shrinkage deformation. The paste with high w/b had higher contents of 
      non-evaporated water and calcium hydroxide, as well as higher reaction degree of 
      DWSA. Nanoscale characterization shows that reducing the w/b reduced the volume 
      fraction of pore and unhydrated phases in the matrix and increased the proportion 
      of high-density C-S-H. Meanwhile, reducing the w/b also reduced the interfacial 
      transition zone width of DWSA-modified concrete. Recycling DWSA in concrete 
      effectively reduced the total carbon footprint and cost of the mixture. The 
      combined application of reducing the w/b and incorporating DWSA effectively 
      improved the economic and environmental benefits of concrete material. For the 
      concrete modified with 10 % DWSA (w/b = 0.3), its cost and carbon emissions are 
      reduced by 14 %-21 % and 19 %-25 % compared with the reference sample, 
      respectively. Overall, this study reveals the action mechanism of DWSA in cement 
      system at different w/b from nanoscale perspective, and gives a new insight on 
      determining the optimal w/b in full-scale application of DWSA concrete.

AB  - The increasing application of plastic film has caused the "white pollution" of 
      farmlands in greenhouses. To date, most studies on the ecology of the 
      plastisphere have focused on the whole microbial community, with few on the rare 
      and abundant taxa, especially in the terrestrial ecosystems. To understand the 
      plastisphere rare and abundant taxa of bacterial and fungal communities, we 
      collected residues of plastic film from plastic-covered soils in the greenhouse. 
      The plastisphere was significantly different from surrounding soils in terms of 
      alpha- and beta-diversities of abundant and rare taxa. Such discrepancies were 
      greater in rare taxa than in abundant taxa. Besides, the enrichment of soil-borne 
      plant pathogenic fungi in the plastisphere implied that plastic film residues can 
      act as vectors for pathogen transmission. In the plastisphere, the stochastic 
      process governed the assemblies of rare taxa, while deterministic assemblies 
      dominated that of abundant taxa. However, in surrounding soils, the stochastic 
      process played a larger role in abundant taxa as compared to rare taxa. The 
      plastisphere showed a network of less complexity, more competitive connections, 
      and more modules compared to surrounding soils, and rare taxa played greater 
      roles than abundant taxa. There existed obvious discrepancies in the microbial 
      functions between surrounding soils and plastisphere, including carbon, sulfur, 
      nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling, and rare taxa contribute large proportions to 
      the above cycling processes. Altogether, the findings advance our understanding 
      of ecological mechanisms of abundant and rare taxa in the plastisphere in 
      terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Perfluorinated compounds (PFASs) are a new artificial chemical. Due to its 
      substantial toxicity and complex degradation in the natural environment, 
      monitoring PFASs has become a hot issue for many researchers. Currently, the 
      relationship between the concentration of PFASs in serum and the concentration of 
      PFASs in drinking water is unclear. This paper aims to study the concentration 
      levels of PFASs in drinking water and residents' serum in Beijing and the 
      relationship between them. The results show that the concentration of PFASs in 
      Beijing drinking water is low, and the average concentrations of 
      perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were 
      2.57 ± 0.69 ng/L and 0.30 ng/L, respectively, which were lower than the limits 
      specified in China's newly introduced Standards for drinking water quality (GB 
      5749-2022). In the serum of Beijing residents, PFOA and PFOS were the two PFASs 
      with the highest concentration. Spearman correlation analysis showed that 
      perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and PFOS concentrations were positively 
      correlated with age, and PFHxS, PFOA, PFNA, and PFOS varied with sex. At the same 
      time, the correlation analysis also showed no correlation between PFAS in 
      drinking water and serum, indicating that drinking water was not the main factor 
      causing the physical burden of PFAS in Beijing residents. The HI method was used 
      to assess the health risks of PFASs to human beings. The risk entropy of all 
      PFASs for human hepatotoxicity and reproductive toxicity is below 1.

AB  - Air pollution regionalization is a key and necessary action to identify pollution 
      regions for implementing control measures. Here we present a new approach called 
      Geographically Weighted Rotation Empirical Orthogonal Function (GWREOF) for air 
      pollution regionalization in China. Compared with previous methods, such as EOF, 
      REOF, and K-mean, GWREOF better accounts for the variability of air pollution 
      conditions driven by emission patterns and meteorology with centralized spatial 
      locations. We apply GWREOF to multiple air pollutants (such as PM(2.5), O(3), and 
      other monitored air pollutants) and air quality metrics using their measured 
      spatial and temporal variations in 337 Chinese cities over 2015-2020. We find 
      that the regionalization results for different air pollutants are highly similar, 
      primarily determined by topography and meteorological conditions in China. 
      Therefore, we propose an integrated regionalization result, which identifies 18 
      air pollution control regions in China and can be applied to multiple pollutants 
      and different years. We further analyze PM(2.5), O(3), and O(x) (O(3) + NO(2)) 
      pollution levels and their correlations in these regions. PM(2.5) and O(3) 
      correlations are generally strongly positive in southern China while negative in 
      northern China. However, PM(2.5) and O(x) correlations are broadly positive in 
      China, reflecting the crucial role of atmospheric oxidizing capacity. 
      Regional-specific and coordinated control measures are in need as China's air 
      pollution strategy transits from PM(2.5)-focused to PM(2.5)-O(3) synergic 
      control.

AB  - As a promising treatment technology for wastewater, the promotion of membrane 
      bioreactors (MBR) is restricted by biological fouling. Among the measures used to 
      mitigate membrane fouling, the addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) to 
      MBRs has been recognized as an effective practice. However, the effects of PAC 
      dosage on the performance of MBRs that treat highly biochemical influent from 
      wastewater treatment plants remain unclear. In this study, by investigating the 
      treatment of biochemical tailwater by PAC-MBRs, we thoroughly analyzed the 
      effects of PAC dosage on the contamination removal efficiency, membrane operation 
      cycles, sludge mixture properties, and microorganism distributions. The results 
      indicated that the addition of PAC enhanced the removal efficiency of MBRs 
      depending on the contaminant of interest. For example, the removal efficiency of 
      total nitrogen can be boosted from 30 % to 60 % with PAC addition, while the 
      removal efficiencies of total phosphorus were comparable with or without PAC 
      addition. Furthermore, the application of PAC in MBRs can prolong the duration of 
      membranes by suppressing biological fouling. This was supported by the decreased 
      microbial products, reduced smaller solid particles, and stronger stability of 
      sludge particles. PAC addition also boosts the proportion of Proteus and 
      decreases the proportion of Bacteroides, which helps to improve the removal 
      efficiencies of contaminants. Finally, among the PAC dosages tested in our study, 
      1.5 g/L PAC was proposed as the optimal candidate for treating highly biochemical 
      influents. For example, the corresponding time for transmembrane pressure to 
      reach 0.03 MPa was 19 d at 1.5 g/L PAC, while these periods were 7 and 14 d at 
      dosages of 0 and 0.5 g/L, respectively. Overall, the findings of this study will 
      aid in the selection of optimal dosages for other systems with different types of 
      influents.

AB  - Anecdotally, clinicians have reported an increase in demand for permanent 
      contraception procedures since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization 
      (Dobbs) decision, which may reflect patients' fear of losing reproductive 
      autonomy. In this commentary we rely upon the history of bias and discrimination 
      in permanent contraception access in the United States to interpret and predict 
      potential outcomes following the Dobbs decision. These findings can shape 
      clinical practice as clinicians aim to balance meeting a patient's contraceptive 
      goals while upholding a commitment to avoid reproductive coercion. We provide 
      recommendations for clinicians' contraceptive counseling to ensure equitable 
      access to permanent contraception for all patients.

AB  - The focus of bee neuroscience has for a long time been on only a handful of 
      social honeybee and bumblebee species, out of thousands of bees species that have 
      been described. On the other hand, the information about chemical ecology of bees 
      is much more abundant. Here we attempted to compile the scarce information about 
      olfactory systems of bees across species. We also review the major categories of 
      intra- and inter-specific olfactory behaviours of bees, with specific focus on 
      recent literature. We finish by discussing the most promising avenues for bee 
      olfactory research in the near future.

AB  - Ovarian cancer is a gynecological tumor with extremely high mortality and poor 
      prognosis. Exosomes derived from tumor cells contain abundant proteins that may 
      influence tumor metastasis. The purpose of our study was to explore the proteomic 
      profile of serum exosomes from Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients and to 
      find potential diagnostic markers for EOC. We obtained purified exosomes from 
      serum using ultracentrifugation. Migration assay was used to evaluate the effects 
      of exosomes on the migration of EOC cells. Proteomic profile of serum exosomes 
      was analyzed by Liquid chromatogram-tande mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The level 
      of LRP1 in serum and serum exosomes were determined by Enzyme-Linked 
      Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Western blot and Immunohistochemistry were used to 
      determine the level of LRP1 in tissues. Moreover, we performed small-interfering 
      RNA-mediated knockdown of LRP1 in EOC cells to obtain SI-LRP1-Exos and 
      SI-NC-Exos. The detailed mechanisms by which exosomal LRP1 affected the migration 
      of EOC cells in vitro and in vivo were also explored. We found that serum 
      exosomes from EOC patients contributed to the migration of EOC cells. The level 
      of serum exosomal LRP1 of EOC patients was significantly upregulated compared 
      with that of healthy volunteers, which was consistent with the result of ELISA. 
      We found that exosomal LRP1 regulated the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 through ERK 
      signaling pathway and affected the migration of EOC cells in vitro and in vivo. 
      Therefore, we propose that exosomal LRP1 contributes to the migration of EOC and 
      may act as an important diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of EOC.

AB  - In recent decades, the primary intention of neuroscientists and psychiatrics is 
      to evaluate the connectivity between brain regions and psychiatric disorders. The 
      amygdala has central immersion in memory alliance, stress response, emotional 
      perception, and automatic responses to emotional stimuli. This paper uses a 
      meta-analysis approach to establish the relationship between structural resting 
      state and functional amygdala connectivity with depression and suicide ideation 
      with suicide behavior. In addition, this study explores the moderating effect of 
      patients' demographic characteristics (gender and age) based on 30 studies. The 
      results show that structural amygdala connectivity is positively related to the 
      instability of depression, while for resting and task functional connectivity 
      amygdala shows a significant negative connection with depression. Furthermore, 
      the amygdala showed a partial activation for non-suicide self-injuries and 
      suicide ideation. From structural and functional magnetic imaging, the current 
      findings also support the moderating effect of the age of the participants on the 
      amygdala connectivity with psychiatric conditions. Generally, amygdala 
      connectivity with psychiatric disorders was not significantly moderate with the 
      role of gender, however, this study enhances the existing hypothetical review 
      articles and confirms the connectivity of the psychological condition with the 
      amygdala region. It concludes that the amygdala plays a vital role in regulating 
      and responding to emotions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with linear accelerator-based 
      stereotactic radiosurgery (LINAC) in cerebellopontine angle meningiomas. METHODS: 
      We analyzed 80 patients diagnosed with cerebellopontine angle meningiomas between 
      2001 and 2014, treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), of whom 81.9% (n=68) 
      were women, with an average age of 59.1 years (32-79). SRS was applied as primary 
      treatment in 83.7% (n=67) and in 16.3% (n=13) as an adjuvant treatment to 
      surgery. SRS treatment was provided using LINAC (Varian 600, 6MeV) with M3 
      micromultilamines (brainLab) and stereotactic frame. The average tumor volume was 
      3.12cm(3) (0.34-10.36cm(3)) and the coverage dose was 14Gy (12-16Gy). We 
      performed a retrospective descriptive analysis and survival analysis was 
      performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis to determine 
      those factors predictive of tumor progression or clinical improvement. RESULTS: 
      After an average follow-up period of 86.9 months (12-184), the tumor control rate 
      was 92.8% (n=77). At the end of the study, there was an overall reduction in 
      tumor volume of 32.8%, with an average final volume of 2.11cm(3) (0-10.35cm(3)). 
      The progression-free survival rate at 5, 10 and 12 years was 98%, 95% and 83.3% 
      respectively. The higher tumor volume (p=0.047) was associated with progression. 
      There was clinical improvement in 26.5% (n=21) of cases and clinical worsening in 
      16.2% (n=13). Worsening is related to the radiation dose received by the 
      brainstem (p=0.02). Complications were 8.7% (7 cases) of hearing loss, 5% (4 
      cases) of brain radionecrosis, and 3.7% (3 cases) of cranial nerve V neuropathy. 
      Hearing loss was related to initial tumor size (p=0.033) and maximum dose 
      (p=0.037). The occurrence of radionecrosis with the maximum dose (p=0.037). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of cerebellopontine angle meningiomas with single-dose SRS 
      using LINAC is effective in the long term. Better tumor control rates were 
      obtained in patients with small lesions.

TI  - Outcomes of Conduction System Pacing for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in 
      Patients with Heart Failure: A Multicenter Experience.

LID - 10.1016/j.hrthm.2023.02.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether conduction system pacing (CSP) is an alternative option for 
      cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with heart failure remains an 
      area of active investigation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the echocardiographic and 
      clinical outcomes of CSP compared to biventricular pacing (BiVP). METHODS: This 
      multi-center retrospective study included patients who fulfilled CRT indications 
      and received CSP. Patients with CSP were matched using propensity score matching 
      and compared in a 1:1 ratio to patients who received BiVP. Echocardiographic and 
      clinical outcomes were assessed. Response to CRT was defined as an absolute 
      increase of ≥5% in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 6 months 
      post-CRT. RESULTS: 238 patients were included. The mean age was 69.8±12.5 years, 
      and 66 (27.7%) were female. 69 (29%) patients had HBP, 50 (21%) patients had 
      LBBAP, and 119 (50%) patients had BiVP. The mean follow-up duration in the CSP 
      and BiVP groups was 269±202 days and 304±262 days, respectively (P=0.293). The 
      proportion of CRT responders was greater in the CSP group as compared to the BiVP 
      group (74% in the CSP group versus 60% in the BiVP group, P=0.042). On Kaplan 
      Meier analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in the time to 
      first heart failure hospitalization (log rank P=0.78) and overall survival (log 
      rank P=0.68) between the CSP group and the BiVP group. CONCLUSION: In patients 
      with HFrEF, CSP resulted in a greater improvement in LVEF compared to BiVP. 
      Large-scale randomized trials are needed to validate these outcomes and further 
      investigate the different options available for CSP.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aging is characterized by progressive metabolic dyshomeostasis that 
      increases morbidity and mortality. Solutions for optimizing healthy aging are 
      challenged by lacking appropriate biomarkers. Moreover, druggable targets to 
      rejuvenate the aging-associated metabolic phenotypes remain unavailable. METHODS: 
      Proteomics analysis was performed in a cohort of young and elderly adults. 
      Circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and fatty acid binding 
      protein 4 (FABP4) were evaluated by ELISA. FABP4 was silenced in elderly mice by 
      adeno-associated virus. Metabolic activities were measured by metabolic cages. 
      Cognitive function was evaluated by Morris water maze. Glucose and lipid 
      metabolism were evaluated by biochemistry assays with blood samples. RNA-seq in 
      mouse liver was performed for transcriptome analysis. RESULTS: Among 9 
      aging-sensitive proteins shared by both male and female, FABP4 was identified as 
      a reliable aging biomarker in both human and mouse. Silencing FABP4 in elderly 
      mice significantly rejuvenated the aging-associated decline in metabolic 
      activities. FABP4 knockdown reversed the aging-associated metabolic disorders by 
      promoting degradation of cholesterol and fatty acids, while suppressing 
      gluconeogenesis. Transcriptome analysis revealed a restoration of the pro-aging 
      gene reprogramming towards inflammation and metabolic disorders in the liver 
      after FABP4 knockdown. FABP4 overexpression promoted human LO2 cell senescence. 
      Moreover, administration of an FABP4 inhibitor BMS309403 delivered metabolic 
      benefits in elderly mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate FABP4 as a 
      reliable aging biomarker as well as a practicable target to improve healthy aging 
      in the elderly.

AB  - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a genetic disease caused by an enzyme 
      deficiency interrupting adrenal steroidogenesis. It most frequently involves 
      21-hydroxylase, which induces adrenal insufficiency with hyperandrogenism. 
      Restoring hormonal balance is difficult with glucocorticoids, which are the 
      gold-standard treatment. Strict normalization of conventional biomarkers 
      (17-hydroxyprogesterone and delta-4 androstenedione) is often obtained at the 
      cost of iatrogenic hypercortisolism. Optimizing the management of these patients 
      first involves using more specific biomarkers of adrenal steroidogenesis in 
      difficult situations, and secondly using therapeutics targeting the induced 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disorder. 11-oxygenated androgens are 
      candidates for biochemical monitoring of Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), in 
      particular 11-ketotestosterone. Numerous new therapeutic agents are currently 
      being explored, the prime goal being to reduce glucocorticoid exposure, as no 
      strategy can fully replace it at present. They can be divided into 3 categories. 
      The first includes "more physiological‿ hydrocortisone administration 
      (modified-release hydrocortisone and continuous subcutaneous infusion of 
      hydrocortisone hemisuccinate); the second includes corticotropin releasing 
      hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor antagonists and 
      anti-ACTH antibodies; and the third includes steroidogenesis inhibitors. Finally, 
      experiments on gene and cell therapies suggest the possibility of lasting 
      remission or even cure in the future.

AB  - In this review we trace the passage of fundamental ideas through 20(th) century 
      cancer research that began with observations on mustard gas toxicity in World War 
      I. The transmutation of these ideas across scientific and national boundaries, 
      was channeled from chemical carcinogenesis labs in London via Yale and Chicago, 
      then ultimately to the pharmaceutical industry in Bielefeld, Germany. These first 
      efforts to checkmate cancer with chemicals led eventually to the creation of one 
      of the most successful groups of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, the 
      oxazaphosphorines, first cyclophosphamide (CP) in 1958 and soon thereafter its 
      isomer ifosfamide (IFO). The giant contributions of Professor Sir Alexander 
      Haddow, Dr. Alfred Z. Gilman & Dr. Louis S. Goodman, Dr. George Gomori and Dr. 
      Norbert Brock step by step led to this breakthrough in cancer chemotherapy. A 
      developing understanding of the metabolic disposition of ifosfamide directed 
      efforts to ameliorate its side-effects, in particular, ifosfamide-induced 
      encephalopathy (IIE). This has resulted in several candidates for the 
      encephalopathic metabolite, including 2-chloroacetaldehyde, 2-chloroacetic acid, 
      acrolein, 3-hydroxypropionic acid and S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine. The pros and 
      cons for each of these, together with other IFO metabolites, are discussed in 
      detail. It is concluded that IFO produces encephalopathy in susceptible patients, 
      but CP does not, by a "perfect storm," involving all of these five metabolites. 
      Methylene blue (MB) administration appears to be generally effective in the 
      prevention and treatment of IIE, in all probability by the inhibition of 
      monoamine oxidase in brain potentiating serotonin levels that modulate the 
      effects of IFO on GABAergic and glutamatergic systems. This review represents the 
      authors' analysis of a large body of published research.

      hospitals across the U.S. PARTICIPANTS: 1,463 participants enrolled in the 
      DVBIC-TBICoE study and divided among non-injured (NIC) (n=191), injured control 
      (IC) (n=349), mild TBI (mTBI) (n=682), and (moderate-severe-penetrating TBI 
      (smcTBI) (n=241) subgroups. 1,550 participants enrolled in the LIMBIC-CENC study 
      and divided between IC (n=285) and mTBI (n=1,265) subgroups. IC and mTBI study 
      groups were compared across demographic and military characteristics, 
      self-reported symptoms, and neuropsychological test scores. INTERVENTIONS: None 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI), PTSD 
      Checklist-Military Version (PCL-C), TBI Quality of Life (TBI-QOL), Test of 
      Premorbid Functioning (TOPF), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) 
      Visual Puzzles, Symbol Search, Coding, Letter-Number Sequencing, and Digit Span, 
      Trail Making Test (TMT), Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System (DKEFS) Verbal 
      Fluency, Letter Fluency, and Category Fluency, California Verbal Learning Test-II 
      (CVLT-II), and Grooved Pegboard (GP). RESULTS: Compared to DVBIC-TBICoE, 
      LIMBIC-CENC participants have higher enrollment age, education level, proportion 
      of Black race, and time from injury as well as less combat deployments and are 
      less likely to be married. The distribution of military service branches also 
      differed. Further, symptom profiles differed between cohorts. LIMBIC-CENC 
      participants endorsed higher posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. 
      DVBIC-TBICoE study IC participants endorsed higher somatosensory and vestibular 
      symptoms (medium effect sizes). Other symptom measure differences had very small 
      effect sizes (≤0.2). Differences were found on many cognitive test results, but 
      are difficult to interpret given the demographic differences and generally very 
      small effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The heavy use of NIH common data elements in 
      both studies and collaboration with the DVBIC-TBICoE study team on development of 
      the LIMBIC-CENC assessment battery enabled this comparative analysis. Results 
      highlight unique differences in study cohorts, and adds perspective and 
      interpretability for assimilating past and future findings.

AB  - Liposomes with enhanced elasticity have been proven to increase the efficiency of 
      drug transport across the skin. The understanding of the background 
      physicochemical processes driving the liposome viscoelastic properties is an 
      essential feature for the design of effective formulations involving different 
      lipids and additive molecules. In this work we use field-cycled nuclear magnetic 
      resonance relaxometry to analyze both the mechanical properties of liposome 
      membranes, and their relationship with the involved molecular dynamics. Different 
      liposomal formulations were considered. We show a correlation between the 
      molecular dynamical regime and mesoscopic physical parameters that define the 
      expected deformability of the vesicles. Results strongly suggest that the purity 
      of the used lipids may influence the elastic properties of the membranes in an 
      appreciable way. Common features in the behaviour of the involved dynamic 
      variables were identified by comparing formulations with surfactants of similar 
      molecular weight.

AB  - Regulation of the intestinal barrier is closely associated with intestinal 
      microbial metabolism. This study investigated the role of propionate, a major 
      short-chain fatty acid produced by intestinal microorganisms, in the regulation 
      of the tight junction (TJ) barrier in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Propionate 
      strengthened TJ barrier integrity, as indicated by decreased permeability to 
      macromolecules and increased transepithelial electrical resistance in 
      Caco-2 cells. DNA microarray analysis revealed that propionate upregulated 
      endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM), a TJ-associated protein, 
      without any increase in other TJ proteins. The upregulation of ESAM was confirmed 
      using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, immunoblotting, and 
      immunofluorescence analyses. Luciferase promoter analysis demonstrated that 
      propionate induced the transcriptional activation of ESAM. The effects of 
      propionate were sensitive to nilotinib inhibition of NR2C2. Overexpression of 
      human ESAM (hESAM) in canine kidney epithelial MDCK-II cells lowered the 
      permeability to macromolecules in a manner similar to that of propionate-treated 
      Caco-2 cells. hESAM overexpression facilitated calcium-induced assembly of the TJ 
      complex in MDCK-II cells. Taken together, propionate strengthened the intestinal 
      TJ barrier by increasing ESAM levels in Caco-2 cells.

AB  - In rural China, the release of bioaerosols containing pathogens from solid waste 
      dumps poses a potential health risk to the local population. Here, we sampled 
      bioaerosols from rural solid waste-treatment in four provinces of northwest China 
      to investigate their emission and dispersion characteristics in order to provide 
      a scientific basis for control and risk reduction of bioaerosols released from 
      rural sanitation facilities. The airborne bioaerosol concentrations and particle 
      size distributions were calculated using an Anderson six-stage airborne microbial 
      sampler and counting with its internal Petri dish culture. High-throughput 
      sequencing was used to characterize the microbial composition at different 
      sampling sites and to explore possible influencing factors, while the health risk 
      associated with exposure was estimated based on average daily dose-rate. The 
      highest concentration point values of bacteria and fungi in bioaerosols near the 
      solid waste were 63,617 ± 15,007 and 8044 ± 893 CFU/m³, respectively. 
      Furthermore, the highest concentration point values of Enterobacteriaceae was 
      502 ± 35 CFU/m³. Most bioaerosols were coarse particles larger than 3.3 μm. 
      Potentially pathogenic genera of winter-indicator species detected in the air 
      were primarily Delftia, Rhodococcus and Aspergillus. The composition of solid 
      waste and environmental conditions are important factors in determining the 
      characteristics of bioaerosols. Local residents are exposed to bioaerosols mainly 
      through inhalation. Children are at a particularly high risk of exposure through 
      both inhalation and skin contact. The results of this study show that bioaerosols 
      in the vicinity of rural solid waste dumps pose a health risk to the surrounding 
      population. More suitable risk assessment criteria for rural areas should be 
      established, and corresponding control and protection measures should be taken 
      from three aspects: generation source and transmission pathway, as well as the 
      recipient.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may 
      have hepatotoxic effects in animals. However, epidemiological evidence in humans, 
      especially pregnant women, is limited. This study aimed to assess the association 
      of single and multiple PFAS exposure with serum markers of liver function in 
      pregnant women. A total of 420 pregnant women from the Guangxi Zhuang Birth 
      Cohort were enrolled from June 2015 to April 2019. Nine PFAS were measured in the 
      maternal serum in early pregnancy. Data for liver function biomarkers, namely, 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
      gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), 
      and indirect bilirubin (IBIL), were obtained from medical records. In generalized 
      linear model (GLM), there was a positive association of perfluorooctane sulfonate 
      (PFOS) with ALT, perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid 
      (PFBS) with GGT, and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) with TBIL and IBIL. In 
      contrast, there was a negative association of perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) 
      with TBIL. There were inverse U-shaped relationships of PFUnA with ALT and AST 
      and PFDA with ALT by restricted cubic spline. The weighted quantile sum (WQS) 
      regression model revealed the positive effects of the PFAS mixture on GGT, TBIL, 
      DBIL, and IBIL. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) analysis confirmed that 
      the PFAS mixture was positively associated with GGT, and PFBS was the main 
      contributor. In addition, the BKMR model showed a positive association of 
      individual PFBS with GGT, individual PFHxS with TBIL and IBIL, and a negative 
      association of individual PFHpA with TBIL. Our findings provide evidence of an 
      association between individual PFAS, PFAS mixture and maternal serum markers of 
      liver function during pregnancy. Additionally, these findings also enhance 
      concerns over PFAS exposure on maternal liver function and PFAS monitoring in 
      pregnancy, reducing the effect of maternal liver dysfunction on maternal and 
      infant health.

AB  - Hourly observations in northern China city of Taiyuan were performed to compare 
      secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) reaction mechanisms, and emission effects on 
      SIA during the pre-lock and COVID-19 lock days. Emission control implemented and 
      meteorological conditions during lock days both caused beneficial impact on air 
      quality. NO(2) showed the highest decrease ratio of -49.5%, while the relative 
      fraction of NO(3)(-) in PM(2.5) increased the most (2.7%). Source apportionment 
      revealed the top three contributors to PM(2.5) were secondary formation (SF), 
      coal combustion (CC), and vehicle exhaust (VE) during both pre-lock and lock 
      days. EC (lock/pre) were all lower than 1, suggesting the overall reduction of 
      primary emissions during lock days, while the higher ratio of (SIA/EC) (lock/pre) 
      (1.01-1.36) indicated the enhanced secondary formation in lock days. The ratio of 
      SIA of pollution to clean days during lock periods considerably higher by 23.7% 
      compared with that in pre-lock periods, which was indicated SIA secondary 
      formation was more pronounced and contributed great to pollution days in lock 
      periods though secondary formation existed in pre-lock and lock periods. Enhanced 
      secondary formation of NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-) during lock days might be mainly 
      due to the increased in aqueous and gas-phase reactions, respectively. Except for 
      SF, high contribution of VE and CC were also important for high SIA concentration 
      in pre-lock and lock days, respectively. The decreased contribution of VE weakens 
      its contribution to SIA formation, indicating the effectiveness of VE emission 
      control, as confirmed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study highlights the 
      aqueous and gas-phase reactions for nitrate and sulfate, respectively, which 
      contributed to heavy pollution, as well as indicated the important role of VE on 
      SIA formation, suggesting the urgent need to further strengthen controls on 
      vehicle emissions.

AB  - Biomass-burning emissions are a significant source of primary organic aerosol 
      (POA). Volatility is one of the most important physical properties of organic 
      aerosol (OA). Dilution and thermodenuder (TD) measurements were used to 
      investigate the volatility of POA from household crop waste combustion in China. 
      Between 10% and 30% of the POA desorbed when diluted from 20:1 to 120:1, while 
      10%-40% of POA evaporated in the TD when heated to 150 °C. Thus, a considerable 
      proportion of the POA emissions were volatile. A dynamic mass transfer model was 
      applied to derived volatility distributions of POA based on TD data. A best fit 
      volatility distributions for POA and associated mass accommodation coefficients 
      (α), and the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH(vap)) were presented. The emissions 
      factors and volatility distribution of POA emission from household crop waste 
      combustion in this study can be used to improve emission inventories and simulate 
      gas-particle partitioning of organic aerosol in chemical transport models.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the fracture resistance (FR) of three combinations of 
      materials for full-arch maxillary implant-supported hybrid prostheses (HPs) with 
      short cantilevers (≤ 10 mm). METHODS: Maxillary HPs were fabricated and 
      classified as follows (n= 5 each): Group-1 (CC-A, control): 
      acrylic-resin-veneered Co-Cr frameworks; Group-2 (CF-A): acrylic-resin-veneered 
      carbon-fiber mesostructures; and Group-3 (CF-R): composite-resin-veneered 
      carbon-fiber frames. Specimens were thermal-cycled (5,000 cycles; 5 °C-55 °C; 
      dwell time: 30 s). Vertical loads were applied until failure, first at the 
      10-mm-long cantilever (LC), and, afterwards, at the anterior region (AR), using a 
      universal testing machine (crosshead speed: 0.05 mm/s). The fracture pattern was 
      assessed by stereomicroscope and SEM. The one-way ANOVA, the Bonferroni, and the 
      independent samples t tests, were run (α= 0.05). RESULTS: At LC, CF-A, and CC-A 
      samples exhibited the highest FR values (p< 0.001), showing no differences to 
      each other. At AR, CC-A specimens recorded the highest FR, followed by CF-A 
      samples (p< 0.001). CF-R HPs displayed the lowest FR at both locations (p< 
      0.001). The only group with differences between the tested sites was the CC-A, 
      the AR being more resistant (p< 0.001). Most CC-A and CF-A HPs failed cohesively. 
      CF-R prostheses mainly failed adhesively. CONCLUSIONS: Maxillary HPs with short 
      cantilevers (≤ 10 mm) made of Co-Cr or carbon-fiber veneered with acrylic resin 
      demonstrated an adequate mechanical resistance (> 900 N). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: 
      For maxillary HPs with cantilevers up to 10 mm, acrylic-veneered carbon- fiber 
      mesostructures may be recommended, whereas coating carbon-fiber frames with 
      composite resin seems not suitable.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) distraction 
      intervention for the management of dental anxiety in paediatric patients. DATA: 
      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of VR distraction interventions for reducing 
      anxiety in paediatric patients, published in English were included. SOURCES: 
      Seven databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE via ProQuest, 
      EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, covering the 
      period between January 2000 and September 2022 were searched. STUDY SELECTION: A 
      total of 12 RCTs involving 818 participants were included. Quality appraisal was 
      undertaken using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials by two 
      authors independently. Random-effects model was used to summarise the effects of 
      the interventions and pool data. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that VR distraction 
      interventions were effective in reducing the dental anxiety of paediatric 
      patients. In meta-analysis, the VR distraction interventions had a significant 
      effect on reducing paediatric patients' anxiety (SMD = -1.74, 95%CI = -2.46, 
      -1.02, p < 0.001, I² = 95%), pain (SMD = -1.57, 95%CI = -2.22, -0.91, p < 0.001, 
      I² = 91%) and heart rate (MD = -10.54, 95%CI = -20.26, -0.81, p = 0.03, I² = 99%) 
      during dental treatment. However, the evidence of VR in managing dental anxiety 
      would become weak because of the publication bias. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: VR 
      distraction interventions could be an effective approach to alleviate the dental 
      anxiety of paediatric patients. Additional well-designed and high-quality RCTs 
      with larger sample sizes are needed to determine the optimal way to deliver VR 
      interventions in paediatric dental clinics.

AB  - Differential regulation of a gene having either canonical or non-canonical cyclic 
      AMP response element (CRE) in its promoter is primarily accomplished by its 
      interactions with CREB (cAMP-response element binding protein). The present study 
      aims to delineate the mechanism of the CREB-CRE interactions at the Oncostatin-M 
      (osm) promoter by in vitro and in silico approaches. The non-canonical CRE(osm) 
      consists of two half-CREs separated by a short intervening sequence of 9 base 
      pairs. In this study, in vitro binding assays revealed that out of the two CRE 
      half-sites, the right half-CRE was indispensable for binding of CREB, while the 
      left sequence showed weaker binding ability and specificity. Genome-wide modeling 
      and high throughput free energy calculations for the energy-minimized models 
      containing CREB-CRE(osm) revealed that there was no difference in the binding of 
      CREB to the right half of CRE(osm) site when compared to the entire CRE(osm). 
      These results were in accordance with the in vitro studies, confirming the 
      indispensable role of the right half-CRE(osm) site in stable complex formation 
      with the CREB protein. Additionally, conversion of the right half-CRE(osm) site 
      to a canonical CRE palindrome showed stronger CREB binding, irrespective of the 
      presence or absence of the left CRE sequence. Thus, the present study establishes 
      an interesting insight into the interaction of CREB with a CRE variant located at 
      the far end of a TATA-less promoter of a cytokine-encoding gene, which in turn 
      could be involved in the regulation of transcription under specific conditions.

AB  - The merits of stem cell therapy and research are undisputed due to their 
      widespread usage in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and demyelinating 
      disorders. Cell replacement therapy especially revolves around stem cells and 
      their induction into different cell lineages both adult and progenitor - 
      belonging to each germ layer, prior to transplantation or disease modeling 
      studies. The nervous system is abundant in glial cells and among these are 
      oligodendrocytes capable of myelinating new-born neurons and remyelination of 
      axons with lost or damaged myelin sheath. But demyelinating diseases generate 
      tremendous deficit between myelin loss and recovery. To compensate for this loss, 
      analyze the defects in remyelination mechanisms as well as to trigger full 
      recovery in such patients mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been induced to 
      transdifferentiate into oligodendrocytes. But such experiments are riddled with 
      problems like prolonged, tenuous and complicated protocols that stretch longer 
      than the time taken for the spread of demyelination-associated after-effects. 
      This review delves into such protocols and the combinations of different 
      molecules and factors that have been recruited to derive bona fide 
      oligodendrocytes from in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and MSCs with special focus on MSC-derived 
      oligodendrocytes.

AB  - Fertility in mammals is ultimately controlled by a small population of neurons - 
      the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons - located in the ventral 
      forebrain. GnRH neurons control gonadal function through the release of GnRH, 
      which in turn stimulates the secretion of the anterior pituitary gonadotropins 
      luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In spontaneous 
      ovulators, ovarian follicle maturation eventually stimulates, via sex steroid 
      feedback, the mid-cycle surge in GnRH and LH secretion that causes ovulation. The 
      GnRH/LH surge is initiated in many species just before the onset of activity 
      through processes controlled by the central circadian clock, ensuring that the 
      neuroendocrine control of ovulation and sex behavior are coordinated. This review 
      aims to give an overview of anatomical and functional studies that collectively 
      reveal some of the mechanisms through which the central circadian clock regulates 
      GnRH neurons and their afferent circuits to drive the preovulatory surge.

AB  - C1q-tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 (CTRP3), an adipokine, has been 
      reported to be closely related to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the 
      effect of CTRP3 on heart failure (HF) remains dimness. This study was to explore 
      the role of CTRP3 in HF and its potential interaction mechanism. Heart failure 
      model was established by inducing ischemia myocardial infarction (MI) through 
      ligation of the left anterior descending artery in Sprague-Dawley rats. Four 
      weeks later, the rats were detected by transthoracic echocardiography and masson 
      staining. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 
      cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and oxidative stress 
      levels were recorded. The level of CTRP3 was reduced in the cardiomyocytes (CMs) 
      treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and in the heart of MI rats. CTRP3 
      overexpression alleviated cardiac dysfunction, attenuated the cardiac fibrosis, 
      and inhibited the increases of ANP, BNP, cTnI and CK-MB in the serum of MI rats. 
      The increases of ANP and BNP in the CMs, and the collagen I and collagen III in 
      the cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) induced by OGD were inhibited by CTRP3 
      overexpression. The enhancement of oxidative stress in the heart of MI rats was 
      inhibited by CTRP3 overexpression. These results indicated that overexpression of 
      CTRP3 could improve cardiac function and the related cardiac fibrosis in 
      MI-induced HF rats via inhibition of oxidative stress. Upregulation of CTRP3 may 
      be a strategy for HF therapy in the future.

AB  - Follistatin is secreted from the liver and may regulate muscle growth and insulin 
      sensitivity. Protein intake stimulates follistatin secretion, which may be 
      mediated by increased glucagon in the context of low insulin concentrations. We 
      investigated circulating follistatin after mixed-meals in two cohorts of patients 
      who were part of previously published studies and had undergone bariatric surgery 
      with either simultaneous assessment of amino acid absorption or administration of 
      the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-(9-39), which increased glucagon 
      concentrations and impaired insulin secretion. Study 1 comprised obese matched 
      subjects with previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) 
      surgery and unoperated controls who underwent 6-hour mixed-meal tests with 
      intravenous and oral tracers including intrinsically labelled caseinate in the 
      meal. Study 2 comprised obese subjects with previous RYGB who underwent two 
      5-hour mixed-meal tests with concomitant exendin-(9-39) or saline infusion. In 
      study 1, the secretion of follistatin as well as the amino acid absorption was 
      accelerated after RYGB compared with SG and controls, but the 
      glucagon-to-C-peptide ratios did not differ between the groups. In study 2, 
      exendin-(9-39) administration increased postprandial glucagon concentrations and 
      lowered insulin secretion, whereas the concentration of follistatin was 
      unchanged. In conclusion, postprandial follistatin secretion is accelerated in 
      patients after RYGB which might be explained by an accelerated protein absorption 
      rate rather than the glucagon-to-insulin ratio.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Kalmegh (Andrographis paniculata) is commonly used for treating 
      uncomplicated Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) in complementary and 
      alternative system of medicine. AP-Bio®(KalmCold®) is a standardized extract 
      derived from the leaves of A. paniculata. This study was proposed to evaluate its 
      efficacy using validated scales and objective measures. METHODS: Participants 
      were randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive either AP-Bio® 200 mg/day, AP-Bio® 
      400 mg/day or placebo for 7 days. The primary outcome measure was Wisconsin Upper 
      Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21) score. The secondary outcome measures were 
      nasal mucous weight, nasal muco-ciliary clearance function and Interleukin-8 in 
      nasal wash, as well as safety and tolerability. RESULTS: A total of n = 331 
      participants were screened and N = 300 participants were enrolled. The absolute 
      WURSS-21 global score [mean (Standard Deviation - SD)] in the AP-Bio® 400 mg 
      group [5.70 (5.31)] was less than the AP-Bio® 200 mg group [5.81 (4.83)] on 
      Day-3. However, it was much higher in the placebo group [9.55 (14.27)]. AP-Bio® 
      400 mg group (Mean Difference - MD [Standard Error - SE] = -3.85 [1.52]; 95% CI = 
      -6.85, - 0.85; adjusted p = 0.034) and 200 mg group (MD [SE] = -3.74 [1.51]; 95% 
      CI = -6.73, - 0.76; adjusted p = 0.038) had significantly lower score than 
      placebo. Similarly, on Day-3, the change in global score from baseline was 
      significantly better in the AP-Bio® 400 mg group (MD [SE] = -3.91; [1.82] 95% CI 
      = -7.50, - 0.32; adjusted p = 0.038) and AP-Bio® 200 mg group (MD [SE] = -3.84 
      [1.97]; 95% CI = -7.72, - 0.04; adjusted p = 0.044) in comparison to the placebo 
      group. Nasal mucous weight, tissue paper counts used, and interleukin-8 showed a 
      trend towards AP-Bio® groups having a favourable outcome when compared with 
      placebo but did not reach statistical significance due to a small sample size. 
      None of the study participants complained of any adverse physical symptoms. 
      However, incident eosinophilia was noted in n = 20 participants on day 3. (n = 6 
      in AP-Bio® 200 mg group, n = 7 in Ap-Bio® 400 mg group and n = 13 in placebo 
      group; p = 0.181). CONCLUSIONS: Participants in both the AP-Bio® dose groups 
      showed positive tendency towards resolution of URTI symptoms when compared with 
      placebo on Day-3 but not on Day-5 and Day-7.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that 
      almonds can improve oxidative stress indices, but the results are controversial. 
      Therefore, the goal of this research was to carry out a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of all RCTs that evaluated the effect of almonds on selected 
      oxidative stress indices. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted up to April 
      2022 on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We have selected the 
      studies that investigated the effects of almonds on malondialdehyde (MDA), and 
      oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) levels in adults. Data were pooled by 
      using the random-effects model. The risk of bias in individual studies was 
      assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Seven RCTs 
      involving 424 participants were analyzed. The results indicated that almond 
      intake led to a significant decrease in MDA levels (WMD: - 6.63 nmol/ml; 95 % CI: 
      - 8.72 to - 4.54; P < 0.001). However, no significant effect was observed on 
      Ox-LDL (Hedges' g: - 0.12; 95 % CI: - 0.34 to 0.10; P = 0.28). Sensitivity 
      analysis showed that overall estimates were not affected by the elimination of 
      any study. We did not observe any evidence regarding publication bias. 
      CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis suggests that almond intake can improve MDA 
      levels and might play a beneficial role in the reinforcement of the antioxidant 
      defense system and amelioration of oxidative stress in adults. There is a need 
      for more studies with larger groups to better estimate this effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction (PGD) is a common 
      complication in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. Several studies 
      have evaluated the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation 
      (TEAS) on PGD, so we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to better 
      understand these studies methodologic limitations and summarize clinical effects. 
      METHODS: Articles (published from January 2010 to April 2022) were searched from 
      the following databases: Wanfang Database, China National Knowledge 
      Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science and Embase. Two 
      authors conducted literature selection, data extraction and statistical analysis 
      independently. This meta-analysis used RevMan 5.4 software to implement 
      statistical analysis and applied Cochrane bias risk tool to assess methodologic 
      weaknesses of included articles. We assessed the effect of TEAS on time to first 
      flatus, first defecation and bowel sound recovery through meta-analyses using a 
      random-effects model. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 10 articles including 
      1497 patients. This study showed that TEAS could effectively promote 
      postoperative gastrointestinal function recovery by analyzing the time to first 
      flatus (MD-14.81 h, 95% CI -15.88 to -13.75 h), time to first defecation 
      (MD-14.68 h, 95% CI -20.59 to -8.76 h), time to bowel sound recovery (MD-5.79 h, 
      95% CI -10.87 to -0.71 h), length of hospital stay (MD-1.48d, 95% CI -1.86 to 
      -1.11d), and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (OR 0.41, 
      95% CI 0.29-0.58). In addition, we assessed the quality of the articles and found 
      small sample sizes and lower methodological quality in some articles. CONCLUSION: 
      Our meta-analysis revealed that TEAS could be a nonpharmacological treatment for 
      PGD in patients after gastrointestinal surgery. However, positive findings should 
      be treated carefully and future studies with high quality and large samples are 
      needed to support this results.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We describe long-term treatment outcomes in patients with 
      multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant (MDR/RR)-tuberculosis (TB) and validate 
      established MDR/RR-TB treatment outcome definitions. METHODS: Among patients with 
      MDR/RR-TB admitted to a German MDR/RR-TB referral center from 
      01.09.2002-29.02.2020, we compared long-term treatment outcomes derived from 
      individual patient follow-up with treatment outcomes defined by WHO-2013, 
      WHO-2021 and TBnet-2016. RESULTS: In total 163 patients (mean age 35 ± standard 
      deviation 13 years, 14/163 [8.6%] living with HIV, 109/163 [66.9%] male, 149/163 
      [91.4%] migrating to Germany within five years) initiated treatment for culture 
      confirmed MDR/RR-TB. Additional drug resistance to a fluoroquinolone or a 
      second-line injectable agent was present in 15/163 (9.2%) of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis strains; resistance against both drug classes was present in 29/163 
      (17.8%) of strains. Median duration of MDR/RR-TB treatment was 20 months 
      (interquartile range [IQR] 19.3-21.6) with a medium of 5 active drugs included. 
      Median follow-up time was 4 years (47.7 months; IQR 21.7-65.8 months). Cure was 
      achieved in 25/163 (15.3%), 82/163 (50.3%) and 95/163 (58.3%) of patients 
      according to WHO-2013, WHO-2021, and TBnet-2016 outcome definitions, 
      respectively. The lost to follow-up rate was 17/163 (10.4%). Death was more 
      likely in patients living with HIV (hazard ratio [HR]=4.28, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 1.26-12.86) and older patients (HR=1.08, 95%CI 1.05-1.12, increment 
      of one year). Overall, 101/163 (62.0%) patients experienced long-term, 
      relapse-free cure; of those, 101/122 (82.8%) patients with a known status (not 
      lost to-follow-up or transferred out) at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Under optimal 
      management conditions leveraging individualized treatment regimens, long-term 
      relapse-free cure from MDR/RR-TB is substantially higher than cure rates as 
      defined by current treatment outcome definitions.

AB  - Fish erythrocytes remain nucleated, unlike mammalian erythrocytes that undergo 
      enucleation during maturation. Besides oxygen transport, fish erythrocytes are 
      capable of several immune defence processes and thus these cells are candidates 
      for carrying out ETotic responses. ETosis is an evolutionary conserved innate 
      immune defence process found in both vertebrates and invertebrates, which 
      involves the extrusion of DNA studded with antimicrobial effector proteins into 
      the extracellular space that traps and kills microorganisms. In this present 
      report, we demonstrate that erythrocytes from Danio rerio (zebrafish) produce 
      ETotic-like responses when exposed to both chemical and physiological inducers of 
      ETosis. Furthermore, erythrocytes from Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon) behaved in a 
      similar way. We have termed these ET-like formations, as Fish Erythrocyte 
      Extracellular Traps (FEETs). Several inducers of mammalian NETosis, such as the 
      protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the 
      calcium ionophore ionomycin, induced FEETs. Moreover, we found that FEETs depend 
      on the activation of PKC and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species 
      (mROS). This present report is the first demonstration that fish erythrocytes can 
      exhibit ETotic-like responses, unveiling a previously unknown function, which 
      sheds new light on the innate immune arsenal of these cells.

AB  - Cyhalofop-butyl (CyB) is a highly effective herbicide and is widely used for weed 
      control in paddy fields. Because CyB is easily residual in the aquatic 
      environment, its potential harm to aquatic organisms has attracted much attention 
      and has not been fully understood. In this study, we systematically explored the 
      hepatotoxic and immunotoxic effects of CyB exposure in zebrafish embryos. 
      Firstly, CyB induced a decrease in the survival rate of zebrafish and led to a 
      series of developmental abnormalities. Meanwhile, CyB can significantly reduce 
      the size of zebrafish liver tissue and the number of hepatocytes in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Secondly, the number of macrophages and neutrophils 
      significantly decreased but the antioxidant enzyme activities such as CAT and MDA 
      were greatly elevated upon CyB exposure. Thirdly, RNA-Seq analysis identified 1, 
      402 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 621 up-regulated and 781 
      down-regulated in zebrafish embryos after CyB exposure. KEGG and GO functional 
      analysis revealed that the metabolic pathways of drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, 
      biosynthesis of antibiotics, and metabolism of xenobiotics, along with 
      oxidation-reduction process, high-density lipoprotein particle and cholesterol 
      transport activity were significantly enriched after CyB exposure. Besides, 
      hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the genes involved in lipid 
      metabolism, oxidative stress and innate immunity were largely activated in 
      CyB-exposed zebrafish. Moreover, CyB induced zebrafish liver injury and increased 
      hepatocyte apoptosis, which increased the protein expression levels of Bax, TLR4, 
      NF-kB p65 and STAT3 in zebrafish. Finally, specific inhibition of TLR signaling 
      pathway by TLR4 knock-down could significantly reduce the expression of 
      inflammatory cytokines induced by CyB exposure. Taken together, these 
      informations demonstrated that CyB could induce the hepatotoxicity and 
      immunotoxicity in zebrafish embryos, and the expression levels of many genes 
      involved in lipid metabolism and immune inflammation were obtained by RNA-Seq 
      analysis. This study provides valuable information for future elucidating the 
      aquatic toxicity of herbicide in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON), a crucial kind of mycotoxin, is found globally present in 
      the contaminated cereal crops including wheat, barley, maize and rice. Hesperidin 
      (HDN) is a flavonoid with a variety of biological activities found in high 
      concentrations in citrus fruits. However, the potential protective effects of HDN 
      on cell damage under DON toxicity, and the role of oxidative stress, 
      inflammation, autophagy and apoptosis in it, remain unclear. Therefore, we 
      treated grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) liver cells (L8824 cell) with DON 
      and HDN for 24 h. The results showed that DON exposure caused a higher ROS 
      accumulation, activated inflammation, autophagy and apoptosis, induced the 
      expression of cytokines (NF-kappaB, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), triggered 
      BCL2/BAX-mediated apoptosis and LC3B/P62-dependent autophagy in the L8824 cell 
      line. Moreover, HDN reduced DON exposure-induced inflammation and autophagy by 
      decreasing ROS accumulation and reduced DON exposure-induced apoptosis by 
      inhibiting JNK phosphorylation. These results partly explained the mechanism of 
      biological threat on fish under DON exposure and the potential application value 
      of HDN in aquaculture.

AB  - Fish skin is a multifunctional tissue that develops during embryogenesis, a 
      developmental stage highly susceptible to epigenetic marks. In this study, the 
      impact of egg incubation temperature on the regeneration of a cutaneous wound 
      caused by scale removal in juvenile European sea bass was evaluated. Sea bass 
      eggs were incubated at 11, 13.5 and 16 °C until hatching and then were reared at 
      a common temperature until 9 months when the skin was damaged and sampled at 0, 1 
      and 3 days after scale removal and compared to the intact skin from the other 
      flank. Skin damage elicited an immediate significant (p < 0.001) up-regulation of 
      pcna in fish from eggs incubated at higher temperatures. In fish from eggs 
      incubated at 11 °C there was a significant (p < 0.001) up-regulation of krt2 
      compared to fish from higher thermal backgrounds 1 day after skin damage. Damaged 
      epidermis was regenerated after 3 days in all fish irrespective of the thermal 
      background, but in fish from eggs incubated at 11 °C the epidermis was 
      significantly (p < 0.01) thinner compared to other groups, had less goblet cells 
      and less melanomacrophages. The thickness of the dermis increased during 
      regeneration of wounded skin irrespective of the thermal background and by 3 days 
      was significantly (p < 0.01) thicker than the dermis from the intact flank. The 
      expression of genes for ECM remodelling (mmp9, colXα, col1α1, sparc, and 
      angptl2b) and innate immunity (lyg1, lalba, sod1, csf-1r and pparγ) changed 
      during regeneration but were not affected by egg thermal regime. Overall, the 
      results indicate that thermal imprinting of eggs modifies the damage-repair 
      response in juvenile sea bass skin.

AB  - Aeromonas salmonicides is a type of Gram-negative bacteria and has become the 
      main fish pathogen in aquaculture because of its characteristics of worldwide 
      distribution, broad host range and potentially devastating impacts. In the past 
      years, studies have been focused to explore the regulatory roles of 
      circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in fish diseases. However, there are only few 
      systematic studies linked to the anti-bacterial roles of circRNA-related ceRNA 
      networks in the spleen immune system of black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii). In 
      this study, the whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted in the 
      black rockfish spleen with A. salmonicida challenging. The differentially 
      expressed (DE) circRNAs were identified comprehensively for the following 
      enrichment analysis. Interactions of miRNA-circRNA pairs and miRNA-mRNA pairs 
      were predicted for the construction of circRNA-related ceRNA regulatory networks. 
      Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of mRNAs from these ceRNA 
      networks were conducted. Finally, a total number of 39 circRNAs exhibited 
      significantly differential expressions during A. salmonicida infection in the 
      black rockfish spleen in 4338 identified circRNAs from 12 samples in 4 libraries. 
      Functional enrichment analysis suggested that they were significantly enriched in 
      several immune-related pathways, including Endocytosis, FoxO signaling pathway, 
      Jak-STST signaling pathway, Herpes simplex infection, etc. Subsequently, 290 
      circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pathways (91 at 2 h, 142 at 12 h and 65 at 24 h) were 
      constructed including 31 circRNAs, 50 miRNAs, and 156 mRNAs. In conclusion, the 
      circRNA-related ceRNA networks were established, which will provide some novel 
      insights in molecular mechanistic investigations of anti-bacterial immune 
      response in teleost. Also, these findings will propose significant predictive 
      values for the development of methods of treatment and prevention in black 
      rockfish after bacterial infection in the future.

AB  - Upon accumulation of improperly folded proteins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum 
      (ER), the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is triggered to restore ER homeostasis. 
      The induction of stress genes is a sine qua non condition for effective adaptive 
      UPR. Although this requirement has been extensively described, the mechanisms 
      underlying this process remain in part uncharacterized. Here, we show that 
      p97/VCP, an AAA+ ATPase known to contribute to ER stress-induced gene expression, 
      regulates the transcription factor GLI1, a primary effector of Hedgehog (Hh) 
      signaling. Under basal (non-ER stress) conditions, GLI1 is repressed by a 
      p97/VCP-HDAC1 complex while upon ER stress GLI1 is induced through a mechanism 
      requiring both USF2 binding and increase histone acetylation at its promoter. 
      Interestingly, the induction of GLI1 was independent of ligand-regulated Hh 
      signaling. Further analysis showed that GLI1 cooperates with ATF6f to induce 
      promoter activity and expression of XBP1, a key transcription factor driving UPR. 
      Overall, our work demonstrates a novel role for GLI1 in the regulation of ER 
      stress gene expression and defines the interplay between p97/VCP, HDAC1 and USF2 
      as essential players in this process.

AB  - AIM: The objectives of the study were to characterize the long-term risk of first 
      recurrence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) among survivors of an incident ACS, 
      as a function of the STEMI/NSTEMI/UA diagnosis. METHODS: Men and women (aged 
      35-74) hospitalized between 2009 and 2016 for an incident ACS in the French 
      MONICA registries and still alive on discharge were followed-up until December 
      2017. Recurrent events were defined as the first (non-fatal or fatal) ACS 
      occurring after hospital discharge from the incident event. RESULTS: The study 
      comprised 15,739 incident ACSs with 63,777 patient-years of follow-up. The 
      cumulative probability [95% confidence interval] of recurrent ACS was 6.7% 
      [6.3-7.1%] at 1 year and 18.4% [17.4-19.5%] at 9 years. The cumulative 
      probability of fatal recurrent ACS was 1.4% [1.2-1.5%] at 1 year and 4.3% 
      [3.6-4.9%] at 9 years. The risk of recurrence did not depend on the type of the 
      incident ACS after adjustment for confounding factors. The most frequent forms of 
      recurrence were NSTEMI and UA. The presence of a major complication (OR = 1.59) 
      and an impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (OR > 1.26) increased 
      the risk of recurrence. The annual 1-year recurrence rates decreased from 7.4% in 
      2009 to 4.0% in 2016 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The recurrence rate after an 
      incident ACS remained high in France, and the risk of recurrence did not depend 
      on the etiology of the first event. Our results emphasize the importance of 
      targeting patients with a major complication and/or an impaired LVEF who are at a 
      higher risk of recurrence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) can induce depressive 
      behaviours and alter the composition of the gut microbiome. Although modulating 
      gut microbiota can improve depression-like behaviour in rats, the mechanism of 
      action is unclear. Additionally, gut microbiota can affect brain function through 
      the neuroendocrine pathway. This pathway may function by regulating the secretion 
      of neurotransmitters such as tryptophan (TRP). Metabolites of TRP, such as 
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and kynurenine (KYN), are related to the 
      pathophysiological process of depression. Indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) 
      and Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) are the key rate-limiting enzymes in TRP 
      metabolism and play an important role in KYN and 5-HT metabolism. METHODS: Rats 
      were subjected to four weeks of CUMS and given rifaximin150 mg/kg by oral gavage 
      daily. After modelling, we investigated the rat's behaviours, composition of the 
      faecal microbiome, neurotransmitter metabolism and key metabolic enzymes of the 
      TRP pathway in the hippocampus (HIP). RESULTS: Rifaximin administration improved 
      depressive behaviour in rats, corrected intestinal microbiota disorders and HIP 
      TRP metabolism and regulated the expression of IDO1 and TPH2 in the HIP. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin improves depression-like behaviour in CUMS rats by 
      influencing the gut microbiota and tryptophan metabolism.

TI  - Treatment with the second-generation antipsychotic quetiapine is associated with 
      increased subgenual ACC activation during reward processing in major depressive 
      disorder.
PG  - 404-412
LID - S0165-0327(23)00270-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2023.02.102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) quetiapine is an essential 
      option for antidepressant augmentation therapy in major depressive disorder 
      (MDD), yet neurobiological mechanisms behind its antidepressant properties remain 
      unclear. As SGAs interfere with activity in reward-related brain areas, including 
      the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) - a key brain region in antidepressant 
      interventions, this study examined whether quetiapine treatment affects ACC 
      activity during reward processing in MDD patients. METHODS: Using the ACC as 
      region of interest, an independent t-test comparing reward-related BOLD response 
      of 51 quetiapine-taking and 51 antipsychotic-free MDD patients was conducted. 
      Monetary reward outcome feedback was measured in a card-guessing paradigm using 
      pseudorandom blocks. Participants were matched for age, sex, and depression 
      severity and analyses were controlled for confounding variables, including total 
      antidepressant medication load, illness chronicity and acute depression severity. 
      Potential dosage effects were examined in a 3 × 1 ANOVA. Differences in 
      ACC-related functional connectivity were assessed in psycho-physiological 
      interaction (PPI) analyses. RESULTS: Left subgenual ACC activity was 
      significantly higher in the quetiapine group compared to antipsychotic-free 
      participants and dependent on high-dose quetiapine intake. Results remained 
      significant after controlling for confounding variables. The PPI analysis did not 
      yield significant group differences in ACC-related functional connectivity. 
      LIMITATIONS: Causal interpretation is limited due to cross-sectional findings. 
      CONCLUSION: Elevated subgenual ACC activity to rewarding stimuli may represent a 
      neurobiological marker and potential key interface of quetiapine's antidepressant 
      effects in MDD. These results underline ACC activity during reward processing as 
      an investigative avenue for future research and therapeutic interventions to 
      improve MDD treatment outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Loneliness and social isolation are known to be associated with 
      depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety. However, knowledge on the 
      overlapping and unique features of these relationships, while differentiating 
      between social loneliness (perceived absence of an acceptable social network) and 
      emotional loneliness (perceived absence of close connections), is lacking. 
      METHODS: We constructed a network analysis to examine the relationships between 
      self-reported social loneliness, emotional loneliness, social isolation, 
      depression, general anxiety and social anxiety in a large sample of university 
      students (N = 7314, 67.4 % female, range 16.3-75.8 years, M(age) = 23.9, 
      SD(age) = 5.7). Hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine whether 
      depression, general anxiety and social anxiety moderated the relationship between 
      social isolation and loneliness types. As comorbidity between anxiety and 
      depression is high, the role of anxiety as a moderator in the relationship 
      between depression and loneliness types was also examined. RESULTS: The network 
      analysis showed that social loneliness was most strongly explained by social 
      isolation, whereas emotional loneliness was most strongly explained by social 
      anxiety and depression. General anxiety was solely related to loneliness through 
      depression. The regression analyses showed that general and social anxiety and 
      depression did not moderate the relationship between social isolation and 
      loneliness types. LIMITATIONS: Differences found between loneliness types may be 
      influenced by a methodological artifact of the DJGLS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      highlight the importance of social anxiety over general anxiety in relation to 
      loneliness. Also, it showed unique relationships for social- and emotional 
      loneliness with psycho-social variables, which has important implications for 
      research- and clinical settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogeneous disease, 
      which brings great difficulties to clinical diagnosis and therapy. Its mechanism 
      is still unknown. Prior neuroimaging studies mainly focused on mean differences 
      between patients and healthy controls (HC), largely ignoring individual 
      differences between patients. METHODS: This study included 112 MDD patients and 
      93 HC subjects. Resting-state functional MRI data were obtained to examine the 
      patterns of individual variability of brain functional connectivity (IVFC). The 
      genetic risk of pathways including dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 
      norepinephrine (NE), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and synaptic 
      plasticity was assessed by multilocus genetic profile scores (MGPS), 
      respectively. RESULTS: The IVFC pattern of the MDD group was similar but higher 
      than that in HCs. The inter-network functional connectivity in the default mode 
      network contributed to altered IVFC in MDD. 5-HT, NE, and HPA pathway genes 
      affected IVFC in MDD patients. The age of onset, duration, severity, and 
      treatment response, were correlated with IVFC. IVFC in the left ventromedial 
      prefrontal cortex had a mediating effect between MGPS of the 5-HT pathway and 
      baseline depression severity. LIMITATIONS: Environmental factors and differences 
      in locations of functional areas across individuals were not taken into account. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study found MDD patients had significantly different 
      inter-individual functional connectivity variations than healthy people, and 
      genetic risk might affect clinical manifestations through brain function 
      heterogeneity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 disarranged lives across mainland China. No 
      study has examined changes in psychological symptoms of healthcare professionals 
      in the intensive care unit (ICU) before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. The 
      aim of this study was to estimate changes in psychological symptoms of ICU 
      healthcare professionals before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to analyze 
      factors related to psychological symptoms. METHODS: Two waves' administrations 
      were implemented between December 13 and December 14, 2018, and between April 5 
      and April 7, 2020, respectively. The symptom checklist-90 (SCL-90) were used to 
      evaluate psychological symptoms. Multiple logistical regression was used to 
      reveal the risk of psychological symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 3902 and 3908 ICU 
      healthcare professionals took part in the first and second surveys. The mean 
      total score of the SCL-90 was 179.27 (70.02) at wave 1 and 147.75 (58.40) at wave 
      2, respectively. The proportion of psychological symptoms was 55.6 % 
      (95%CI = 54.0-57.1) at wave 1. But rates of psychological symptoms decreased to 
      36.6 % (95%CI = 35.1-38.2) at wave 2. ICU healthcare professionals with western 
      economic belt and 6-10 years of work were more likely to develop psychological 
      symptoms, while ICU healthcare professionals with the later survey and doctoral 
      degree were less likely to develop psychological symptoms. CONCLUSION: Although 
      COVID-19 period benefited psychological symptoms of ICU healthcare professionals, 
      psychological symptoms still had a related high prevalence. Regular screening and 
      appropriate interventions should still be implemented to decrease the risk for 
      psychological symptoms among Chinese ICU healthcare professionals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Feelings of entrapment and deficits in social problem-solving skills 
      have been associated with risk for suicidal behavior in the context of 
      depression. However, few studies have examined the effect of age on the 
      association between these risk factors and suicidal behavior across most of the 
      adult lifespan. METHODS: In a three-site study, we tested interactions of age 
      with feelings of entrapment and social problem-solving style in 105 depressed 
      patients with a recent suicide attempt, 95 depressed patients with no history of 
      suicide attempt, and 97 demographically similar non-psychiatric participants (age 
      16-80). Attempter/non-attempter differences, age interactions, and the relative 
      contribution of entrapment and social problem-solving style to past attempter 
      were examined. RESULTS: Entrapment significantly interacted with age such that it 
      discriminated past attempters from depressed non-attempters better at older ages. 
      Social Problem-Solving Inventory (SPSI) total score and most subscales did not 
      distinguish past attempters, but the SPSI Impulsive Style Problem-Solving was an 
      effective discriminator of past suicide attempts across the full adult lifespan 
      and did not interact with age. In a multipredictor model, both the entrapment by 
      age interaction and SPSI Impulsive Style Problem-Solving score were significant 
      predictors for the classification of attempters. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional 
      nature of our research design limited conclusions that may be drawn about 
      individual change over time or cohort effects. CONCLUSIONS: Entrapment did not 
      distinguish past attempters at younger ages but became a better discriminator in 
      middle to late adulthood. An impulsive problem-solving style was associated with 
      past suicide attempts across the full adult lifespan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide hotlines are widely used, with potential for identification 
      of callers at especially high risk. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted 
      at the largest psychological support hotline in China. From 2015 to 2017, all 
      distressed callers were consecutively included and assessed, using a standardized 
      scale consisting of 12 elements, yielding scores of high risk (8-16), moderate 
      risk (4-7), and low risk (0-3) for suicidal act. All high-risk and half of 
      moderate- and low-risk callers were scheduled for a 12-month follow-up. Main 
      outcomes were suicidal acts (nonlethal attempt, death) over follow-up. RESULTS: 
      Of 21,346 fully assessed callers, 5822, 11,791, and 3733 were classified as 
      high-, moderate-, or low-risk for suicidal acts, with 8869 callers (4076 high-, 
      3258 moderate-, and 1535 low-risk) followed up over 12 months. Over follow-up, 
      802 (9.0 %) callers attempted suicide or died by suicide. The high-risk callers 
      (15.1 %) had 3-fold higher risk for subsequent suicidal acts than moderate- 
      (5.1 %) and 12-fold higher risk than low-risk callers (1.3 %). The weighted 
      sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of high risk scores were 
      56.4 %, 74.9 %, and 14.4 %. LIMITATIONS: Assessed callers with different risk 
      levels were followed disproportionally. CONCLUSIONS: Suicidal risk assessment 
      during a hotline call is both feasible and predictive of risk, guiding resource 
      allocation to higher risk callers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Helplessness and hopelessness are states closely related to 
      depressive disorders. They ensue following the anticipated absence of valid 
      behavioral options to alleviate an aversive state. One neural structure involved 
      in the detection of such options, is the cingulate cortex (CC), which conveys the 
      evaluation of behavior against the value of its outcome. Accordingly, CC-related 
      EEG measures are thought to correlate to feedback evaluation but also to anxious 
      and conflict-related states, signaling the need for further adaptation to current 
      requirements. Against this background, this study investigated the role of CC 
      functioning in the emergence and prevention of helpless/hopeless states by 
      applying low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (litFUS) neuromodulation 
      prior to a learned helplessness task. METHOD: In a randomized controlled double 
      blind experimental setup with 55 participants, litFUS was used to inhibit the 
      right lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), a region closely connected to CC 
      modulation. Participants were instructed to play 8 games of chess against a 
      computer that was unbeatable to them, while an EEG was recorded. Theta 
      oscillation in midline electrodes, playing performance and self-rate measures on 
      cognitive, affective and physiological parameters were assessed. RESULTS: The 
      results show a considerable influence of litFUS neuromodulation of the lPFC on 
      midline theta activity (Fz and Pz electrode position) which in turn correlated to 
      several psychological variables including self-report data on emotion, cognition, 
      and arousal as well as behavioral measures (playing performance). LIMITATIONS: 
      Due to the small sample size and sample characteristics, results cannot be 
      generalized to the field of clinical application. A replication of results in 
      larger samples and in context of other sonication parameters is needed to 
      increase the robustness of results and to maximize the efficacy of litFUS 
      application. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the development of learned 
      helplessness/hopelessness could be positively influenced in its course by litFUS 
      neuromodulation of the right lPFC. In line with previous results, especially the 
      posterior midline electrode Pz seems to be an interesting target for further 
      research in this field as theta activity at this electrode is correlated to 
      control perception and motivated behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first 
      study to use neuromodulation to monitor and manipulate the development of 
      helplessness in the laboratory.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: There have pieces of evidence of the distinct aberrant functional 
      network topology profile in bipolar disorder (BD) across mania, depression, and 
      euthymic episodes. However, the underlying anatomical network topology pattern in 
      BD across different episodes is unclear. METHODS: We calculated the whole-brain 
      probabilistic structurally connectivity across 143 subjects (72 with BD [34 
      depression; 13 mania; 25 euthymic] and 53 healthy controls), and used graph 
      theory to examine the trait- and state-related topology alterations of the 
      structural connectome in BD. The correlation analysis was further conducted to 
      explore the relationship between detected network measures and clinical symptoms. 
      RESULTS: There no omnibus alteration of any global network metrics were observed 
      across all diagnostic groups. In the regional network metrics level, bipolar 
      depression showed increased clustering coefficient in the right lingual gyrus 
      compared with all other groups, and the increased clustering coefficient in the 
      right lingual gyrus positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and illness 
      burden symptoms but negatively correlated with mania symptoms; manic and euthymic 
      patients showed decreased clustering coefficient in the left inferior occipital 
      gyrus compared with HCs. LIMITATIONS: The moderate sample size of all patient 
      groups (especially for subjects with mania) might have contributed to the 
      negative findings of the trait feature in this study. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      demonstrated the altered regional connectivity pattern in the occipital lobe of 
      the bipolar depression and mania episode, especially the lingual gyrus. The 
      association of the clustering coefficient in the lingual gyrus with clinical 
      symptoms helps monitor the state of BD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have linked gut microbiota to human brain activity. 
      This study used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal 
      relationship between gut microbes and delirium. METHODS: MR was used to select 
      SNPs from large-scale GWAS summary data on 211 gut microbiota taxa and delirium. 
      Inverse variance weighting (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger methods were used 
      for statistical analyses. Outliers were assessed using the leave-one-out method. 
      To avoid horizontal pleiotropy, we performed the MR-PRESSO and MR-Egger intercept 
      tests. Cochran's Q and I(2) values for IVW and MR-Egger were used to assess 
      heterogeneity. RESULTS: IVW suggested that genetic prediction of the family 
      Desulfovibrionaceae (1.784 (1.267-2.512), P = 0.001), order Desulfovibrionales 
      (1.501 (1.058-2.128), P = 0.023), and genus Candidatus Soleaferrea (1.322 
      (1.052-1.659), P = 0.016) increased the risk of delirium, but the family 
      Oxalobacteraceae (0.841 (0.722-0.981), P = 0.027), and genera Holdemania (0.766 
      (0.620-0.946), P = 0.013), Ruminococcus gnavus (0.806 (0.661-0.982), P = 0.033), 
      and Eggerthella (0.815 (0.667-0.997), P = 0.047) reduced the risk of delirium. 
      LIMITATIONS: (1) Limited sample size, (2) inability to assess gut microbiota 
      interactions, and (3) limited to European populations. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      suggest that presence of the microbial family Desulfovibrionaceae, order 
      Desulfovibrionales, and genus Candidatus Soleaferrea increased the risk of 
      delirium, whereas the Oxalobacteraceae family, and the genera Holdemania, 
      Ruminococcus gnavus, and Eggerthella decreased the risk of delirium. However, the 
      potential of gut probiotic interventions in the prevention of perioperative 
      delirium should be emphasized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) are at 
      risk of suicide. Sleep and circadian rhythm alterations are widely recognized as 
      core symptoms of major depressive disorder and are associated with suicidal 
      ideation. Thus, sleep and circadian rhythm alterations may be targeted to prevent 
      suicide. METHODS: Patients were recruited from a prospective cohort of the French 
      network of TRD expert centers. Mood, sleep and circadian rhythms were assessed at 
      baseline; suicidal risk was assessed both at baseline and during a one-year 
      follow-up with standardized subjective questionnaires. RESULTS: Excessive daytime 
      sleepiness (adjusted odds ratio aOR = 1.7(1-3.3), p = 0.04) and daytime 
      dysfunction (aOR = 1.81(1.16-2.81), p = 0.0085) increased the risk of suicidal 
      thoughts over the one-year follow-up period in patients with TRD after adjustment 
      on age, gender, depression, trauma, anxiety, impulsivity, current daily tobacco 
      smoking and body mass index. Hypnotics intake is associated with a reduced risk 
      of suicidal ideation at one-year follow-up after the same adjustments 
      (OR = 0.73(0.56-0.95), p = 0.019). Other associations between sleep quality or 
      circadian rhythms and suicidal ideations at either baseline or one year did not 
      remain significant in multivariate analyses after the same adjustments. 
      LIMITATIONS: Sleep assessments were based on self-reported questionnaires rather 
      than objective measures. CONCLUSIONS: Daytime sleepiness and dysfunction are 
      predictors of suicidal ideations, whereas hypnotics intake is associated with a 
      reduced risk of suicidal ideations. Diurnal symptoms of sleep disturbances are 
      therefore red flags to target for preventing suicide in depressed patients, and 
      hypnotics seem efficient in preventing suicide for patients with TRD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional cardiovascular risk indicators only partially explain 
      cardiovascular risks in depressed persons. Depressed persons may exhibit a 
      profile of cardiovascular risk indicators that goes beyond traditional 
      cardiovascular risk indicators, such as symptom severity, insomnia, loneliness 
      and neuroticism, yet research on the added value of these depression-related 
      characteristics in predicting cardiovascular risks of depressed persons is 
      scarce. METHODS: Data from N = 1028 depressed Dutch adults without prevalent CVD 
      were derived from two longitudinal depression cohort studies. The outcome was 
      medication-confirmed self-reported CVD. Fifteen depression-related clinical and 
      psychological characteristics were included and tested against traditional 
      cardiovascular risk indicators. Data were analysed using Cox regression models. 
      Incremental values of these characteristics were calculated using c-statistics. 
      RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 65.3 months, 12.7% of the participants 
      developed CVD. Only anxiety and depressive symptom severity were associated with 
      incident CVD beyond traditional cardiovascular risk indicators. The c-statistic 
      of the model with traditional cardiovascular risk indicators was 85.47%. This 
      increased with 0.56 or 0.33 percentage points after inclusion of anxiety or 
      depression severity, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Other relevant depression-related 
      characteristics were not available in the datasets used. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and 
      depressive symptom severity were indicative of an increased cardiovascular risk. 
      Including these as additional risk indicators barely improved the ability to 
      assess cardiovascular risks in depressed persons. Although traditional 
      cardiovascular risk indicators performed well in depressed persons, existing risk 
      prediction algorithms need to be validated in depressed persons.

TI  - Blocking osteopontin expression attenuates neuroinflammation and mitigates 
      LPS-induced depressive-like behavior in mice.
LID - S0165-0327(23)00273-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2023.02.105 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the development of 
      major depressive disorder (MDD). Osteopontin (OPN) is one of the key molecules 
      involved in neuroinflammation. We demonstrate here for the first time a key role 
      of OPN in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behavioral syndrome. 
      METHODS: Systemic administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) mimics distinct depressive-like 
      behavior, which could significantly upregulate OPN expression in 
      microglia/macrophage in the hippocampus. The neurobehavioral assessments, 
      quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), 
      Western blot, immunofluorescent staining, flow cytometry cell staining and Golgi 
      staining were performed. RESULTS: Similar to fluoxetine treatment (the positive 
      control), OPN knockdown with shRNA lentivirus markedly reversed LPS-induced 
      depressive-like behavior. Moreover, knockdown of OPN suppressed LPS-induced 
      proinflammatory cytokine expression, microglial activation, dendritic spines 
      loss, as well as unregulated PSD-95 and BDNF in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: We 
      demonstrated that targeting OPN expression in microglia/macrophage might help to 
      rescue LPS-induced depressive-like behavior. The underlying mechanism may relate 
      to the modulation of neuroinflammation, BDNF signaling and synaptic structural 
      complexity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Population aging has caused an increase in strokes in very elderly 
      patients (VEP). We assess how secondary prevention of ischemic stroke has changed 
      in VEP in recent decades. METHOD: Retrospective study of discharges due to 
      ischemic stroke in the Virgen Macarena, Virgen del Rocio and Valme hospitals in 
      Seville (Spain), during the periods 1999-2001, 2014-16 and 2019-2020. VEP were 
      considered those with ≥80 years. RESULT: We studied 1806 patients, 349 (19.3%) 
      were VEP. Over the years, VEPs have doubled (13.5% vs. 25.9% and 28% p = 0.0001) 
      and age has increased (83.3 ± 3 vs. 84.1 ± 3 vs. 85.2 ± 4 p = 0.001). Comparing 
      the periods, the VEPs have more hypertension (69.9% vs. 84.8% vs. 84.6%; p = 
      0.0001) and dyslipidemia (12% vs. 41.7% vs. 52.3%; p = 0.0001) and have 
      prescribed more antihypertensives (69.1% vs. 86.7% vs. 92.3%; p = 0.0001), 
      statins (5.3% vs. 78% vs. 81.5%; p = 0.0001) and anticoagulants (16.5% vs. 19.4% 
      vs. 53.1%; p = 0.001), increasing the number of antihypertensives (1 ± 0.9 vs. 
      1.6 ± 0, 9 vs. 1.9 ± 0.8 drugs p = 0.0001), and high-intensity statins (2.3% vs. 
      42.7 vs. 69.2% p = 0.0001). Comparing the VEPs with the younger ones, there were 
      no differences in antihypertensive treatment in any period, there were 
      differences in antithrombotic treatment in the first period, and with statins the 
      differences were maintained until the end. CONCLUSIONS: In the last 20 years the 
      number of VEPs has doubled, exceeding a quarter of the discharges. Although there 
      is improvement in secondary stroke prevention in VEPs, there is room for 
      improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma 
      cruzi, in which up to 10-20% of those affected may suffer digestive disorders. 
      Multiple studies have been carried out on CD in non-endemic countries, mainly 
      related to cardiological involvement. However, digestive disorders have not been 
      analyzed in such depth. The objective of the study was to determine the 
      prevalence of digestive disorders in imported CD at the time of first care. 
      METHODS: An observational cross-sectional descriptive analysis of imported CD was 
      performed. Chagasic structural damage and infectious digestive comorbidity were 
      evaluated. The association between Chagasic structural damage and heart disease 
      in Chagas patients was also investigated. RESULTS: After reviewing a total of 
      1,216 medical records, those of 464 patients were selected for analysis. 
      Globally, the prevalence of digestive disorders in imported Chagas was 57.76%, 
      95% CI (53.25-62.27). The prevalence of comorbidity of infectious diseases was 
      40.73% CI 95% (36.25-45.22). Colonic abnormalities were found in 84 of 378 barium 
      enema patients. CD-related esophageal abnormalities were present in 63 of 380 
      patients studied with esophagogram. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of digestive 
      disorders associated with CD is high, so the presence of infectious diseases 
      (mainly parasitic and H. pylori infection) should be ruled out. It is important 
      to exclude structural involvement in all symptomatic patients, and asymptomatic 
      patients should also be considered and offered.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The stomach experiences large volume and shape changes 
      during pre-operative gastric radiotherapy. This study evaluates the dosimetric 
      benefit for organs-at-risk (OARs) of a library of plans (LoP) compared to the 
      traditional single-plan (SP) strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients who 
      received SP CBCT-guided pre-operative gastric radiotherapy (45 Gy; 25 fractions) 
      were included. Clinical target volume (CTV) consisted of CTV(stomach) (i.e., 
      stomach + 10 mm uniform margin minus OARs) and CTV(LN) (i.e., regional lymph node 
      stations). For LoP, five stomach volumes (approximately equidistant with fixed 
      volumes) were created using a previously developed stomach deformation model 
      (volume = 150-750 mL). Appropriate planning target volume (PTV) margins were 
      calculated for CTV(stomach) (SP and LoP, separately) and CTV(LN). Treatment plans 
      were automatically generated/optimized and the best-fitting library plan was 
      manually selected for each daily CBCT. OARs (i.e., liver, kidneys, heart, spleen, 
      spinal canal) doses were accumulated and dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters 
      were evaluated. RESULTS: The non-isotropic PTV(stomach) margins were 
      significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for LoP than SP (median = 13.1 vs 19.8 mm). For 
      each patient, the average PTV was smaller using a LoP (difference range 
      134-1151 mL). For all OARs except the kidneys, DVH parameters were significantly 
      reduced using a LoP. Differences in mean dose (Dmean) for liver, heart and spleen 
      ranged between -1.8 to 5.7 Gy. For LoP, a benefit of heart Dmean > 4 Gy and 
      spleen Dmean > 2 Gy was found in 4 and 5 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: A 
      LoP strategy for pre-operative gastric cancer reduced average PTV and reduced OAR 
      dose compared to a SP strategy, thereby potentially reducing risks for 
      radiation-induced toxicities.

TI  - Endonasopharyngeal Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Features of 
      Recurrent Retropharyngeal Nodes in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients: A 
      Radiologic-histopathologic Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The imaging criteria of malignant retropharyngeal lymph node (RLN) in 
      nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) have yet to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to 
      establish predictive models based on ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) 
      characteristics for identifying malignant RLN in NPC patients after radiotherapy. 
      METHODS: 81 post-radiotherapy NPC patients with abnormal enlargement of RLN 
      underwent endonasopharyngeal ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirations (EPUS-FNA) 
      to access the nature of RLN. The following features were assessed on US and MR: 
      size, margin, vascular signal, echogenicity, enhancement signal and accompany 
      with suspicious cervical nodes or not. A multivariate analysis was performed to 
      screen out high-risk imaging features for recurrent RLN (RRLN), and models for 
      the diagnosis of RRLN was constructed and tested with internal verification. We 
      evaluated the clinical usefulness of the models through comparison of C-index and 
      decision curve analysis. RESULTS: High-risk features of RRLN were heterogeneous 
      echo (p < 0.01), vascular signal (p < 0.01) on EPUS, heterogeneous enhancement (p 
      < 0.01) and minimum axis diameter >10 mm (p < 0.01) on MR. The models based on 
      the US and MR features showed good discrimination (AUC of 0.76 in the US model, 
      0.74 in the MR model and 0.77 in the US+MR model) and good net benefit in the 
      validation group. CONCLUSION: Prediction models based on the US and MR features 
      show good diagnostic performance for RRLN after radiotherapy in NPC patients. The 
      combination of EPUS and MR may be constructed to provide prompt and reliable 
      guidance to manage RLN.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has improved the 
      limited overall survival (OS) of patients with intensively pretreated diffuse 
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the potentially life-threatening 
      toxicities of CAR T-cells and early relapses remain a challenge. As suggested by 
      smaller monocentric analyses, radiotherapy (RT) in combination with CAR T-cells 
      may have an immunomodulatory effect. METHOD/ RESULTS: In this multicentric 
      retrospective analysis, we investigated potentially synergistic effects of RT and 
      CAR T-cells. Of 78 patients from four centers who received CAR T-cell therapy for 
      DLBCL, 37 patients underwent bridging RT or received salvage RT. RTs (median 36 
      gray) were well tolerated. Therapy response and disease control of CAR T-cell 
      therapy were comparable after bridging RT or bridging systemic therapy. 
      High-grade neurotoxicity tended to occur less frequently after bridging RT. After 
      further disease progression, patients with localized relapses showed better 
      outcomes, compared to those in advanced stage. In the subgroup with localized 
      relapse, patients receiving salvage RT had an increased OS, vs. those without 
      salvage RT (1-year OS rate 89% vs. 38%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our analysis 
      demonstrated that RT in combination with CAR T-cells led neither to high-grade 
      toxicities, nor to a decreased response rate. We observed better outcomes of 
      salvage therapies in patients with localized relapses vs. those with advanced 
      stage relapses. Especially the patients who received salvage RTs for localized 
      relapses seem to benefit more. Further analyses are necessary to clarify whether 
      specific synergistic effects exist, such as an enhanced anti-tumor effect of CAR 
      T-cells from RT sensitizing.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy (RIBP), resulting in 
      symptomatic motor or sensory deficits of the upper extremity, is a risk after 
      exposure of the brachial plexus to therapeutic doses of radiation. We sought to 
      model dosimetric factors associated with risks of RIBP after stereotactic body 
      radiotherapy (SBRT). METHODS: From a prior systematic review, 4 studies were 
      identified that included individual patient data amenable to normal tissue 
      complication probability (NTCP) modelling after SBRT for apical lung tumors. Two 
      probit NTCP models were derived: one from 4 studies (including 221 patients with 
      229 targets and 18 events); and another from 3 studies (including 185 patients 
      with 192 targets and 11 events) that similarly contoured the brachial plexus. 
      RESULTS: NTCP models suggest ≈10% risks associated with brachial plexus maximum 
      dose (D(max)) of ∼32-34 Gy in 3 fractions and ∼40-43 Gy in 5 fractions. RIBP 
      risks increase with increasing brachial plexus D(max). Compared to previously 
      published data from conventionally-fractionated or moderately-hypofractionated 
      radiotherapy for breast, lung and head and neck cancers (which tend to utilize 
      radiation fields that circumferentially irradiate the brachial plexus), SBRT 
      (characterized by steep dose gradients outside of the target volume) exhibits a 
      much less steep dose-response with brachial plexus D(max) > 90-100 Gy in 2-Gy 
      equivalents. CONCLUSIONS: A dose-response for risk of RIBP after SBRT is observed 
      relative to brachial plexus D(max). Comparisons to data from less conformal 
      radiotherapy suggests potential dose-volume dependences of RIBP risks, though 
      published data were not amenable to NTCP modelling of dose-volume measures 
      associated with RIBP after SBRT.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a deep learning model that combines CT and radiation dose 
      (RD) images to predict the occurrence of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in lung 
      cancer patients who received radical (chemo)radiotherapy. METHODS: CT, RD images 
      and clinical parameters were obtained from 314 retrospectively-collected patients 
      (training set) and 35 prospectively-collected patients (test-set-1) who were 
      diagnosed with lung cancer and received radical radiotherapy in the dose range of 
      50 Gy and 70 Gy. Another 194 (60 Gy group, test-set-2) and 158 (74 Gy group, 
      test-set-3) patients from the clinical trial RTOG 0617 were used for external 
      validation. A ResNet architecture was used to develop a prediction model that 
      combines CT and RD features. Thereafter, the CT and RD weights were adjusted by 
      using 40 patients from test-set-2 or 3 to accommodate cohorts with different 
      clinical settings or dose delivery patterns. Visual interpretation was 
      implemented using a gradient-weighted class activation map (grad-CAM) to observe 
      the area of model attention during the prediction process. To improve the 
      usability, ready-to-use online software was developed. RESULTS: The 
      discriminative ability of a baseline trained model had an AUC of 0.83 for 
      test-set-1, 0.55 for test-set-2, and 0.63 for test-set-3. After adjusting CT and 
      RD weights of the model using a subset of the RTOG-0617 subjects, the 
      discriminatory power of test-set-2 and 3 improved to AUC 0.65 and AUC 0.70, 
      respectively. Grad-CAM showed the regions of interest to the model that 
      contribute to the prediction of RP. CONCLUSION: A novel deep learning approach 
      combining CT and RD images can effectively and accurately predict the occurrence 
      of RP, and this model can be adjusted easily to fit new cohorts.

AB  - In radiotherapy, radiation-quality should be an expression of the biological and 
      physical characteristics of ionizing radiation such as spatial distribution of 
      ionization or energy deposition. Linear energy transfer (LET) and lineal energy 
      (y) are two descriptors used to quantify the radiation quality. These two 
      quantities are connected and exhibit similar features. In ion-beam therapy (IBT), 
      lineal energy can be measured with microdosimeters, which are specifically 
      designed to cope with the high fluence of particles in clinical beams, while the 
      quantification of LET is generally based on calculations. In pre-clinical 
      studies, microdosimetric spectra are used for the indirect determination of 
      relative biological effectiveness (RBE), e.g., using the microdosimetric kinetic 
      model (MKM) or biophysical response functions. In this context it is important to 
      consider saturation effects, which occur when the highest values of y become less 
      biologically relevant compared to the relative contribution they make to the 
      physical dose. Recent clinical data suggests that local tumor control and normal 
      tissue effects can be linked to macroscopic and microscopic dosimetry parameters. 
      In particular, positive clinical outcomes have been correlated to the highest LET 
      values in the density distribution, and there is no evident link to the 
      saturation discussed above. A systematic collection of microdosimetric 
      information in combination with clinical data in retrospective studies may 
      clarify the role of radiation quality at the highest LET. In the clinical 
      setting, microdosimetry is not widely used yet, despite its potential to be 
      linked with LET by experimentally-determined y values. Through this connection, 
      both play an important role in complex therapy techniques such as intensity 
      modulated particle therapy (IMPT), LET-painting and multi-ion optimization. This 
      review summarizes the current state of microdosimetry for IBT and its potential, 
      as well as research and development needed to make experimental microdosimetry a 
      mature procedure in a clinical context.

AB  - Deficiencies in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been linked to 
      several brain disorders, making compounds that can boost neuronal BDNF synthesis 
      attractive as potential therapeutics. However, a sensitive and quantitative BDNF 
      assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) is still missing. Here we report the 
      generation of a new mouse Bdnf allele, Bdnf(NLuc), in which the sequence encoding 
      nano luciferase (NLuc) is inserted into the Bdnf locus immediately before the 
      stop codon so that the allele will produce a BDNF-NLuc fusion protein. BDNF-NLuc 
      protein appears to function like BDNF as Bdnf(NLuc/NLuc) homozygous mice grew and 
      behaved almost normally. We were able to establish and optimize cultures of 
      cortical and hippocampal Bdnf(NLuc/+) neurons isolated from mouse embryos in 
      384-well plates. We used the cultures as a phenotypic assay to detect the ability 
      of 10 mM KCl to stimulate BDNF synthesis and achieved a reproducible Z' factor > 
      0.50 for the assay, a measure considered suitable for HTS. We successfully scaled 
      up the assay to screen the 1280-compound LOPAC library (Library of 
      Pharmacologically Active Compounds). The screen identified several BDNF-boosting 
      compounds, one of which is Bay K8644, a L-type voltage-gated calcium channel 
      (L-VGCC) agonist, which was previously shown to stimulate BDNF synthesis. These 
      results indicate that our phenotypic neuronal assay is ready for HTS to identify 
      novel BDNF-boosting compounds.

AB  - Prior infections can provide protection or enhance susceptibility to a subsequent 
      infection through microorganism's interaction or host immunomodulation. 
      Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Cryptococcus gattii (CG) cause lungs infection, 
      but it is unclear how they interact in vivo. This study aimed to study the 
      effects of the primary SA lung infection on secondary cryptococcosis caused by CG 
      in a murine model. The mice's survival, fungal burden, behavior, immune cells, 
      cytokines, and chemokines were quantified to evaluate murine cryptococcosis under 
      the influence of a previous SA infection. Further, fungal-bacterial in vitro 
      interaction was studied in a culture medium and a phagocytosis assay. The primary 
      infection with SA protects animals from the subsequent CG infection by reducing 
      lethality, improving behavior, and impairing the fungal proliferation within the 
      host. This phenotype was associated with the proinflammatory antifungal host 
      response elicited by the bacteria in the early stage of cryptococcosis. There was 
      no direct inhibition of CG by SA, although the phagocytic activity of macrophages 
      was reduced. Identifying mechanisms involved in this protection may lead to new 
      approaches for preventing and treating cryptococcosis.

TI  - The use of an Anatomical Implant Compared to a Straight LCP Decreases Extraction 
      in Posterior Humeral MIPO.

LID - 10.1016/j.recot.2023.02.008 [doi]
AB  - Purpose Posterior MIPO approach in the humerus has been described by using a 
      4.5mm LCP plate. Although straight plates have shown good results, they have not 
      been designed to adapt to the distal humeral metaphysis. The goal of the study 
      was to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in hardware removal 
      after posterior MIPO with either a straight or a pre-contoured plate. Methods 
      Patients older than 18 years, who had suffered mid-distal humeral shaft fracture, 
      were treated by a posterior MIPO technique with a locking plate and had a minimum 
      of 12-month follow-up were retrospectively included. Patients were separated 
      into: group 1 (LCP 4.5mm straight plate); and group 2 (3.5mm anatomically shaped 
      plate). Clinical and radiological evaluation were performed in the postoperative 
      period. Patient-reported outcomes and the need of hardware removal because of 
      pain were assessed. Results Sixty-seven patients fulfilled the inclusion 
      criteria. Twenty-seven patients in group 1 and 40 in group 2. No patient was lost 
      to follow-up. There were no statistical differences between in patient reported 
      outcomes measures. All the fractures healed. Within group 1, 18% (95%CI 6 - 38%) 
      of the patients required implant removal while in group 2 this incidence was 0% 
      (95%CI 0 - 9%) (p 0.009). Conclusion These results suggest that the use of a 4.5 
      mm LCP compared to an anatomical 3.5 mm LCP in posterior MIPO of the humerus 
      generates greater discomfort and therefore leads to a 18% increase in the risk of 
      implant removal.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the existing knowledge on the effectiveness of machine 
      learning (ML) algorithms inpredicting defibrillation success during in- and 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus were 
      searched from inception to August 30, 2022. Studies were included that utilized 
      ML algorithms for prediction of successful defibrillation, observed as return of 
      spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital or discharge, or 
      neurological status at discharge.Studies were excluded if involving a trauma, an 
      unknown underlying rhythm, an implanted cardiac defibrillator or if focused on 
      the prediction or onset of cardiac arrest. Risk of bias was assessed using the 
      PROBAST tool. RESULTS: There were 2399 studies identified, of which 107 full text 
      articles were reviewed and 15 observational studies (n=5680) were included for 
      final analysis. 29 ECG waveform features were fed into 15 different ML 
      combinations. The best performing ML model had an accuracy of 98.6 (98.5 - 
      98.7)%, with 4 second ECG intervals. An algorithm incorporating end-tidal CO2 
      reported an accuracy of 83.3% (no CI reported). Meta-analysis was not performed 
      due to heterogeneity in study design, ROSC definitions, and characteristics. 
      CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms, specifically Neural Networks, have been 
      shown to have potential to predict defibrillation success for cardiac arrest with 
      high sensitivity and specificity.Due to heterogeneity, inconsistent reporting, 
      and high risk of bias, it is difficult to conclude which, if any, algorithm is 
      optimal. Further clinical studies with standardized reporting of patient 
      characteristics, outcomes, and appropriate algorithm validation are still 
      required to elucidate this. PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020148912.

AB  - AIMS: The incidence of in hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) varies throughout the 
      day. This study aimed to report the variation in incidence of IHCA, presenting 
      rhythm and outcome based on the hour in which IHCA occurred. METHODS: We 
      conducted a retrospective analysis of the National Cardiac Arrest Audit (NCAA) 
      including patients who suffered an IHCA from 1st April 2011 to 31st December 
      2019. We then linked the NCAA and intensive care Case Mix Programme databases to 
      explore the effect of time of IHCA on hospital survival in the subgroup of 
      patients admitted to intensive care following IHCA. RESULTS: We identified 
      115,690 eligible patients in the NCAA database. Pulseless electrical activity was 
      the commonest presenting rhythm (54.8%). 66,885 patients died in the immediate 
      post resuscitation period. Overall, hospital survival in the NCAA cohort was 
      21.3%. We identified 13,858 patients with linked ICU admissions in the Case Mix 
      Programme database; 37.0% survived to hospital discharge. The incidence of IHCA 
      peaked at 06.00. Rates of return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital 
      discharge and good neurological outcome were lowest between 05.00 and 07.00. 
      Among those admitted to ICU, no clear diurnal variation in hospital survival was 
      seen in the unadjusted or adjusted analysis. This pattern was consistent across 
      all presenting rhythms. CONCLUSIONS: We observed higher rates of IHCA, and poorer 
      outcomes at night. However, in those admitted to ICU, this variation was absent. 
      This suggests patient factors and processes of care issues contribute to the 
      variation in IHCA seen throughout the day.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of intestinal injury in cardiac arrest is not established. 
      The first aim of this study was to assess associations between clinical 
      characteristics in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and a biomarker for 
      intestinal injury, Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein (IFABP). The second aim 
      was to assess associations between IFABP and multiple organ dysfunction and 
      30-day mortality. METHODS: We measured plasma IFABP in 50 patients at admission 
      to intensive care unit (ICU) after OHCA. Demographic and clinical variables were 
      analysed by stratifying patients on median IFABP, and by linear regression. We 
      compared Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, haemodynamic 
      variables, and clinical-chemistry tests at day two between the "high" and "low" 
      IFABP groups. Logistic regression was applied to assess factors associated with 
      30-day mortality. RESULTS: Several markers of whole body ischaemia correlated 
      with intestinal injury. Duration of arrest and lactate serum concentrations 
      contributed to elevated IFABP in a multivariable model (p < 0.01 and p = 0.04, 
      respectively). At day two, all seven patients who had died were in the "high" 
      IFABP group, and all six patients who had been transferred to ward were in the 
      "low" group. Of patients still treated in the ICU, the "high" group had higher 
      total, renal and respiratory SOFA score (p < 0.01) and included all patients 
      receiving inotropic drugs. IFABP predicted mortality (OR 16.9 per standard 
      deviation increase, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Cardiac arrest duration and lactate 
      serum concentrations were risk factors for intestinal injury. High levels of 
      IFABP at admission were associated with multiple organ dysfunction and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: After resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) by 
      Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the amount of time that should be dedicated to 
      pre-transport stabilization is unclear. We examined whether the time spent 
      on-scene after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was associated with 
      patient outcomes. METHODS: We examined consecutive adult EMS-treated OHCAs from 
      the British Columbia Cardiac Arrest registry (January 1/2019-June 1/2021) that 
      had on-scene ROSC (sustained to scene departure). The primary outcome was 
      favourable neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category ≤ 2) at hospital 
      discharge; secondary outcomes were re-arrest during transport and 
      hospital-discharge survival. Using adjusted logistic regression models, we 
      estimated the association between the post-resuscitation on-scene interval 
      (divided into quartiles) and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1653 cases, 611 (37%) survived 
      to hospital discharge, and 523 (32%) had favourable neurological outcomes. The 
      median post-resuscitation on-scene interval was 18.8 minutes (IQR:13.0-25.5). 
      Compared to the first post-resuscitation on-scene interval quartile, neither the 
      second (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.19; 95% CI 0.72-1.98), third (AOR 1.10; 95% 
      CI 0.67-1.81), nor fourth (AOR 1.54; 95% CI 0.93-2.56) quartiles were associated 
      with favourable neurological outcomes; however, the fourth quartile was 
      associated with a greater odds of hospital-discharge survival (AOR 1.73; 95% CI 
      1.05-2.85), and both the third (AOR 0.40; 95% CI 0.22-0.72) and fourth (AOR 
      0.44;95% CI 0.24-0.81) quartiles were associated with a lower odds of 
      intra-transport re-arrest. CONCLUSION: Among resuscitated OHCAs, increased 
      post-resuscitation on-scene time was not associated with improved neurological 
      outcomes, but was associated with improved survival to hospital discharge and 
      decreased intra-transport re-arrest.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Studies support rapid interventions to improve outcomes in patients 
      with in-hospital cardiac arrest. We sought to decrease the time to code team 
      activation and improve dissemination of patient-specific data to facilitate 
      targeted treatments. METHODS: We mapped code blue buttons behind each bed to 
      patients through the electronic medical record. Pushing the button sent 
      patient-specific data (admitting diagnosis, presence of difficult airway, and 
      recent laboratory values) through a secure messaging system to the responding 
      teams' smartphones. The code button also activated a hospital-wide alert through 
      the operator. We piloted the system on seven medicine inpatient units from 
      November 2019 through May 2022. We compared the time from code blue button press 
      to smartphone message receipt vs traditional operator-sent overhead page. 
      RESULTS: The code button was the primary mode of code team activation for 12/35 
      (34.3%) cardiac arrest events. The code team received smartphone notifications a 
      median of 78 s (IQR = 47-127 s) before overhead page. The median time to 
      adrenaline administration for codes activated with the code button was not 
      significantly different (240 s (IQR 142-300 s for code button) vs 148 s 
      (IQR = 34-367 s) for overhead page, p = 0.89). Survival to discharge was 3/12 
      (25.0%) for codes activated with the code button vs 4/23 (17.4%) when activated 
      by calling the operator (p = 0.67). CONCLUSION: Implementation of a 
      smartphone-based code button notification system reduced time to code team 
      activation by 78 s. Larger cohorts are necessary to assess effects on patient 
      outcomes.

AB  - Smaller electrodes allow more options for design of automated external 
      defibrillator (AED) user interfaces. However, previous studies employing 
      monophasic-waveform defibrillators found that smaller electrode sizes have lower 
      defibrillation shock success rates. We hypothesize that, for 
      impedance-compensated, biphasic truncated exponential (BTE) shocks, smaller 
      electrodes increase transthoracic impedance (TTI) but do not adversely affect 
      defibrillation success rates. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective 
      before-and-after clinical study, Amsterdam police and firefighters used AEDs with 
      BTE waveforms: an AED with larger electrodes in 2016-2017 (113 cm(2)), and an AED 
      with smaller electrodes in 2017-2020 (65 cm(2)). We analyzed 157 and 178 patient 
      cases with an initial shockable rhythm where the larger and smaller electrodes 
      were used, respectively. A single 200-J shock terminated ventricular fibrillation 
      (VF) in 86% of patients treated with large electrodes and 89% of patients treated 
      with smaller electrodes. Small electrodes had a non-inferior first shock 
      defibrillation success rate compared to large electrodes, with a difference of 3% 
      (95% CI: -3% -9%) with the lower confidence limit remaining above the defined 
      non-inferiority threshold. TTI was significantly higher for the smaller 
      electrodes (median: 100 Ω) compared to the larger electrodes (median: 88 Ω) 
      (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: For AEDs with impedance-compensating BTE waveforms, TTI 
      was higher for smaller electrodes than the large electrode electrodes. Overall 
      defibrillation shock success for AEDs with smaller electrodes was non-inferior to 
      the AEDs with larger electrodes.

AB  - Very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare disorder of 
      β-oxidation fatty acid metabolism that results in susceptibility to hypoglycemia, 
      liver failure, cardiomyopathy and rhabdomyolysis during catabolic situations. We 
      report the case of a 10-year-old male undergoing a totally implanted central 
      venous catheter placement during hospitalisation for rhabdomyolysis, who was 
      successfully managed with general anesthesia with nitrous oxide, sevoflurane and 
      remifentanil. No hypoglycemia occurred and creatine kinase levels did not 
      increase in the perioperative period. We describe the challenges encountered and 
      the strategies used to avoid further decompensation of the disease due to 
      surgical stress.

TI  - Spinal anesthesia does not cause left ventricular dysfunction in patients older 
      than 60 years without cardiovascular disease.
LID - S2341-1929(23)00047-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.redare.2022.01.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are undergoing surgery more frequently than ever. In 
      this population, spinal anesthesia, which is known to cause sympathetic blockade 
      associated with arterial vasodilation, is proposed as an excellent option. 
      However, its effects on left ventricular systolic function have not been studied. 
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate left ventricular systolic function by transthoracic 
      echocardiography in patients older than 60 years, without prior cardiovascular 
      disease, under spinal anesthesia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective observational 
      study with a total of 54 patients older than 60 years without prior 
      cardiovascular disease, in whom, after the completion of subarachnoid anesthesia 
      with hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine with sensory block equal to or greater than T10, 
      left ventricular systolic function was measured using MAPSE. In addition, CI-IVC, 
      LVOT-VTI and CO were measured. Values at 5 min after the blockade were compared 
      with those obtained previously. RESULTS: A 3.3% decrease in MAPSE and a slight 
      decrease in LVOT-VTI and CO were found, with no statistical or clinical 
      significance. 14.8% of the patients presented MAP equal to or less than 60 mmHg. 
      Comparison of echocardiographic changes between hypotensive and non-hypotensive 
      patients was not statistically significant or clinically relevant. DISCUSSION: 
      Our study shows that spinal anesthesia with anesthetic level T10 or higher in 
      patients older than 60 years without cardiovascular disease is a safe technique 
      since it does not significantly alter echocardiographic parameters measuring left 
      ventricular systolic function.

AB  - We describe a patient with pneumocephalus following lumbar decompression surgery 
      who presented altered mental status at time to awake of anaesthesia and the 
      patient was admitted in intesive care unit in mechanical ventilation. The patient 
      has not eye-opening response, no verbal response and motor response only withdraw 
      in response to pain (7 points on Glasgow coma scale). Then, the patient 
      experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Immediate cranial computed 
      tomography (CT) images were performed. Cerebral pneumocephalus was present in CT, 
      imaging revealed a voluminous pneumocephalus responsible for a 
      significantspace-occupying effect on the frontal and parietal lobes, lateral 
      ventricles and quadrigeminal plate cistern. Anti-epileptic therapy (Diazepam and 
      levetiracetam) and neurological monitoring were initiated. At 12 postoperative 
      hours repeat CT scanning showed pneumocephalus were completely improved to 
      minimal quantity and only limited to frontal lobe. The consciousness is impaired, 
      and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure was present. Electroencephalogram showed 
      continuous epileptiform activity and phenytoin IV was administered in continuous 
      infusión. Four hours later the level of consciousness gradually improved, and the 
      patient was right in eye opening, verbal and motor responses. A few hours later 
      the patient was extubated, and no neurological deficits were present. 
      Pneumocephalus should be considered in the differential diagnosis when evaluating 
      a patient with altered mental status following lumbar surgery.

AB  - Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is the most common enzyme disease of 
      red blood cells, with around 400 million people suffering from it throughout the 
      world and linked to the X chromosome inheritance, thus it predominantly affects 
      men. Glucose 6-phosphate-dehydrogenase participates in the pentose-phosphate 
      pathway, being responsible for cellular metabolism and the production of 
      antioxidants. A deficiency of this enzyme alters its ability to protect red blood 
      cells from oxidative stress caused by certain drugs, metabolic conditions, 
      infections and food. Specific anesthetic considerations are required to reduce 
      the morbidity and mortality associated with medical-surgical interventions in 
      patients with this disease. This article presents the case of a 45-year-old man 
      with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency who underwent combined general 
      anaesthesia for programmed low anterior resection of the rectum.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 induces coagulopathy associated with an increase of 
      thromboembolic events. Due to the lack of agreement on recommendations for 
      thromboprophylactic management, the aim of this study was to study the dosages of 
      LMWH used in critically ill COVID-19 patients assessing the effect on their 
      outcome. METHODS: We evaluated data of the Reg-COVID19. According to LMWH dose 
      two groups were analyzed: prophylaxis and treatment. Primary outcome was the 
      relationship of LMWH dosage with mortality. Secondary outcomes included the 
      incidence of thrombotic and bleeding events, length of ICU stay, invasive 
      mechanical ventilation, and thrombotic and inflammatory parameters. RESULTS: Data 
      of 720 patients were analyzed, 258 in the prophylaxis group and 462 in the 
      treatment group. C Reactive Protein, invasive mechanical ventilation, tocilizumab 
      and corticosteroid treatments were related with the choice of LMWH dose. 
      Hemorrhagic events (66/720, 9.2%) and thrombotic complications (69/720, 9.6%) 
      were similar in both groups (p = .819 and p = .265), as was the time course of 
      the thrombotic events, earlier than hemorrhagic ones (9 [3-18] and 12 [6-19] days 
      respectively). Mortality was lower in prophylaxis group (25.2% versus 35.1%), but 
      once an inverse probability weighting model was applied, we found no effect of 
      LMWH dose. CONCLUSION: We found no benefit or harm with the administration of 
      therapeutic or prophylactic LMWH dose in COVID19 critically ill patients. With a 
      similar rate of hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, the LMWH dose had no influence 
      on mortality. More studies are needed to determine the optimal thromboprophylaxis 
      protocol for critically ill patients.

      level is a rare but potentially serious complication of these procedures, which 
      must be diagnosed quickly for urgent repair. We present the case of a patient who 
      presented with gastric herniation in the early postoperative period of a left 
      pneumonectomy due to pleural mesothelioma. The clinical findings were mild, but 
      supported by imaging tests, they confirmed the diagnostic hypothesis and 
      facilitated the solution of the condition. Possible contributing factors are 
      reviewed and the need for early diagnosis and treatment is emphasized to avoid 
      ischemia of herniated abdominal viscera in the thoracic cavity, due to the risk 
      of necrosis and contamination by fecaloid material.

AB  - Prehabilitation programs that combine exercise training, nutritional support, and 
      emotional reinforcement have demonstrated efficacy as a strategy for preoperative 
      optimization in abdominal surgery. The experience in cardiac surgery, one of 
      those associated with greater morbidity and mortality, is anecdotal. OBJECTIVE: 
      evaluation of the feasibility of a multimodal prehabilitation program and its 
      effect on functional capacity in patients candidates for elective cardiac 
      surgery. METHODS: Pilot study conducted from July 2017 to June 2018 in patients 
      candidates to myocardial revascularization and/or valve replacement. The program 
      consisted of: 1) supervised exercise training program, 2) breathing incentive 
      exercises, 3) nutritional support, and 4) mindfulness training. An evaluation was 
      carried out prior to the start of the program and at the end of it 
      (preoperatively). RESULTS: All patients except one who refused surgery, completed 
      the program, which lasted an average of 45 days. No patients presented 
      complications related to the program. The program induced a significantly 
      increase in functional capacity measured by the six-minute walking test 
      (510.7 + 62 m vs 534.3 + 71 m, p = 0.007) and the chair test (13.2 + 4, 7 vs 
      16.4 + 7 repetitions, p = 0.02), as well as an increase in the level of physical 
      activity measured by the Yale physical activity questionnaire (37.6 + 20 vs 
      54.2 + 27; p = 00029). CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal prehabilitation in patients 
      candidates for elective cardiac surgery is feasible and it increases functional 
      capacity preoperatively without being associated with complications. The presumed 
      beneficial impact of this improvement on the incidence of postoperative 
      complications and hospital stay, requires further investigation.

LID - 10.1016/j.redare.2022.01.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in spinal cord injured patients has specific issues that 
      must be carefully addressed. However, guidelines for their management are scarce. 
      METHODS: A systematic review of the literature regarding the anaesthetic 
      management during delivery of pregnant patients with cervical spinal cord injury 
      was performed on the electronic databases of PubMed (Medline) and Cochrane. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-two papers were included. A higher incidence of preterm birth and 
      caesarean delivery were seen. Anaesthetic management was diverse, although most 
      pregnant patients received epidural analgesia. Autonomic dysreflexia symptoms 
      were present in 51% of pregnancies. CONCLUSION: Timely management of these 
      patients could possibly reduce caesarean and preterm delivery rates, avoid or 
      minimize common complications, as well as reduce costs. An early reference to 
      anaesthesiology consultation and a multidisciplinary approach is recommended.

TI  - Clinical differences in a multidisciplinary pediatric pain unit between primary 
      and secondary chronic pain.
LID - S2341-1929(23)00044-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.redare.2021.12.004 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain affects an important part of the pediatric population 
      in developed countries. secondary chronic pain (SCP) can have a well-defined 
      medical cause, but primary chronic pain (PCP) can have an unknown etiology. In 
      Spain, there is as yet no information on the clinical differences between 
      patients treated in multidisciplinary units. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 
      the clinical records of patients seen in 2018 at the Children's Chronic Pain Unit 
      in University La Paz Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were included, 
      (age between 3 and 19 years), with a mean age of 12.4 (SD = 4.1) years, mostly 
      female (55%), with a mean duration of pain of 11.3 (SD = 10.4) months. A 
      comparison of patients with PCP (n = 31) and SCP (n = 61) showed that both 
      groups, on average, presented intense pain (X = 5.9; SD = 2.2; range = 0-10), 
      with similar duration and functional repercussions, although PCP was less likely 
      to be associated with neuropathic descriptors than SCP (p = 0.040), and was more 
      extensive (p < 0.001). Both groups received similar treatment, based on 
      rehabilitation, psychotherapy, invasive techniques and analgesic medication, 
      although patients in the PCP group received less analgesic medication 
      (gabapentinoids and opioids) than the SCP (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Patients 
      treated in a multidisciplinary Child Pain Unit for PCP or SCP present a very 
      similar clinical profile, though with differences in the number and type of 
      analgesic drugs used. This shows the importance of etiologic diagnosis for 
      adequate pharmacological treatment.

TI  - Would surgical Apgar score be useful to predict postoperative complications after 
      proximal femoral fracture surgery? - A retrospective cohort study.
LID - S2341-1929(23)00058-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.redare.2022.02.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The surgical Apgar score (SAS) is a perioperative risk evaluation 
      score, which considers intraoperative minimum heart rate, minimum mean arterial 
      pressure and estimated blood loss. Although validated in multiple surgical 
      fields, SAS remains quite controversial in the orthopedic one. The main purpose 
      of this study was to investigate if SAS relates with the occurrence of 
      complications during the first 30-days after proximal femoral fracture surgery. 
      METHODS: Retrospective study including all consecutive patients submitted to 
      proximal femoral fracture surgery between January and July 2019. Patients with no 
      information about SAS were excluded. Patients were divided in two groups, based 
      on the occurrence of complications during the first 30 post-operative days and 
      their SAS calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to 
      assess SAS power as a predictive model of complications. RESULTS: Forty-two 
      percent (n = 76) of the 181 patients included in the study developed 
      complications during the first 30 postoperative days. Eight patients (4,4%) died 
      during that period. The patient's mean age was 79 years and 30,9% (n = 56) were 
      men. Heart failure, pacemaker use, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease and dementia were significantly associated with post-operative 
      morbidity. There was no significant correlation between SAS and the occurrence of 
      complications during the first 30 postoperative days. The AUC of SAS as a 
      predictive model for postoperative complications after proximal femoral fracture 
      surgery was 0,522, being insufficient to be considered an accepted model of 
      prediction. CONCLUSION: Based on this study, we conclude that SAS is not 
      predictive of the development of complications in the first 30 post-operative 
      days in patients submitted to proximal femoral fracture surgery. However, other 
      clinical factors have been identified as associated with postoperative morbidity. 
      In the future, prospective-based studies with higher samples may better clarify 
      the role of SAS in this context.

AB  - The aberrant right subclavian artery has an incidence of 0.5%-1% in the 
      population, generally with retroesophageal location. It can lead to the formation 
      of an arterio-esophageal fistula in patients with predisposing risk factors due 
      to devices placed in esophageal or tracheal position, as it is particularly 
      susceptible to extrinsic compression and pressure necrosis. We present the case 
      of a patient with a postsurgical tracheoesophageal fistula, who developed massive 
      bleeding due to an arterioesophageal fistula secondary to an unknown aberrant 
      right subclavian artery. For hemostatic management, alternative maneuvers were 
      performed, such as the placement of a Foley-type urinary catheter at the point of 
      bleeding and the subsequent placement of a Sengstaken-Blakemore balloon in 
      cranial position. Given the severity of the condition and the possible diagnostic 
      delay, it seems appropriate to consider performing a preoperative CT angiography 
      in patients with risk factors who undergo these procedures.

AB  - Spontaneous subcapsular hepatic hematoma (SSHH) with or without previous history 
      of preeclampsia and/or HELLP syndrome represents a very rare pathological 
      condition in pregnancy and postpartum, (1/45,000-1/225,000 pregnancies). Its 
      importance for the anesthesiologist lays in its association with high morbidity 
      and mortality for the mother (60-86%, 39%) and newborn (42%). After a high 
      clinical suspicion, the certainty clinical diagnosis is settled by different 
      imaging techniques. However, in most cases the diagnosis of SSHH is a casual 
      intraoperative finding associated to a maternal or foetal compromise. Nowadays 
      the obstetric and anaesthetic management of a SSHH is not standardized and 
      depends on its integrity, hemodynamic stability and the gestational period when 
      diagnosed. The possibility of an acute critic haemorrhage with necessity of 
      massive transfusion, makes advisable to provide updated protocols for the 
      treatment of obstetric hemorrhage, adapting them to the clinical peculiarities of 
      these patients. After the acute phase, close attention should be kept on 
      thromboembolic complications.

AB  - This study discussed the adsorption of mixed heavy metal ions (Cu(2+), Co(2+), 
      Pb(2+)) and phosphate ions by ten pristine biochars and those with precipitated 
      Mg/Al layered double hydroxide (LDH). The pristine biochars have adsorption 
      capacities of 6.9-13.4 mg/g for Cu(2+), 1.1-9.7 mg/g for Co(2+), 7.8-20.7 mg/g 
      for Pb(2+), and 0.8-4.9 mg/g for PO(4)(3-). The LDH-biochars have markedly 
      increased adsorption capacities of 20.4-25.8 mg/g for Cu(2+), 8.6-15.0 mg/g for 
      Co(2+), 26.5-40.4 mg/g for Pb(2+) with mixed metal ions, and 13.0-21.8 mg/g for 
      PO(4)(3-). Part of the Mg ions but Al ions are released from the LDH-biochars 
      during adsorption, counting less than 7.2% of the adsorbed ions. The pristine 
      biochars have specific adsorption sites for Cu(2+) and Co(2+), separate Pb(2+) 
      sites related to ether groups on biochar, and areal-dependent sites for 
      PO(4)(3-). There is no universal adsorption mechanism corresponding to mixed 
      metal ion adsorption for individual pristine biochar involving different 
      contributions of C-O-C, C-O-H, and CO groups and graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N, and 
      pyridine-N groups. The LDH complexes with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups of 
      biochar, and the LDH interacts with biochar's ether groups, which contributes to 
      metal adsorption, against the conception that the biochar is merely a carrier of 
      LDH as adsorbents.

AB  - Accurate prediction of effluent total nitrogen (E-TN) can assist in feed-forward 
      control of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to ensure effluent compliance with 
      standards while reducing energy consumption. However, multivariate time series 
      prediction of E-TN is a challenge due to the complex nonlinearity of WWTPs. This 
      paper proposes a novel prediction framework that combines a two-stage feature 
      selection model, the Golden Jackal Optimization (GJO) algorithm, and a hybrid 
      deep learning model, CNN-LSTM-TCN (CLT), aiming to effectively capture the 
      nonlinear relationships of multivariate time series in WWTPs. Specifically, 
      convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and temporal 
      convolutional network (TCN) combined to build a hybrid deep learning model 
      CNN-LSTM-TCN (CLT). A two-stage feature selection method is utilized to determine 
      the optimal feature subset to reduce the complexity and improve the accuracy of 
      the prediction model, and then, the feature subset is input into the CLT. The 
      hyperparameters of the CLT are optimized using GJO to further improve the 
      prediction performance. Experiments indicate that the two-stage feature selection 
      model learns the optimal feature subset to predict best, and the GJO-CLT achieves 
      the best performance for different backtracking windows and prediction steps. 
      These results demonstrate that the prediction system excels in the task of 
      multivariate water quality time series prediction of WWTPs.

AB  - Food waste (FW) contains many nutritional components such as proteins, lipids, 
      fats, polysaccharides, carbohydrates, and metal ions, which can be reused in some 
      processes to produce value-added products. Furthermore, FW can be converted into 
      biogas, biohydrogen, and biodiesel, and this type of green energy can be used as 
      an alternative to nonrenewable fuel and reduce reliance on fossil fuel sources. 
      It has been demonstrated in many reports that at the laboratory scale production 
      of biochemicals using FW is as good as pure carbon sources. The goal of this 
      paper is to review approaches used globally to promote turning FW into useable 
      products and green energy. In this context, the present review article highlights 
      deeply in a transdisciplinary manner the sources, types, impacts, 
      characteristics, pre-treatment strategies, and potential management of FW into 
      value-added products. We find that FW could be upcycled into different valuable 
      products such as eco-friendly green fuels, organic acids, bioplastics, enzymes, 
      fertilizers, char, and single-cell protein, after the suitable pre-treatment 
      method. The results confirmed the technical feasibility of all the reviewed 
      transformation processes of FW. Furthermore, life cycle and techno-economic 
      assessment studies regarding the socio-economic, environmental, and engineering 
      aspects of FW management are discussed. The reviewed articles showed that energy 
      recovery from FW in various forms is economically feasible.

AB  - Various catalysts in homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis deploy unconventional 
      reaction pathways by lowering the activation energy (AE) barrier, controlling the 
      selectivity, and creating environmental impact, thereby bringing about economic 
      viability. Hence, the study of these methodologies is of immense interest. To 
      develop a new chemistry, there is much scope for the invention of brilliant 
      candidates that could effectively catalyze diverse reaction methodologies. The 
      palladium-catalyzed reactions motivate interesting applications on various 
      organic transformations under mild reaction conditions. Although phosphorous 
      designed ligands or catalysts have been used, despite their expensiveness, 
      sensitivity and other properties, there is the necessity of developing even 
      better cross-coupling ligands or catalysts such as N-heterocyclic carbene 
      (NHC)-based palladium complexes. These palladium-NHCs (Pd-NHC) are novel and 
      universal nucleophilic entities that have come into light as the most successful 
      class of catalysts in organometallic chemistry. In the same class, a specific 
      category of palladium-NHCs such as palladium-pyridine enhanced pre-catalyst 
      preparation by the stabilization initiation (palladium-PEPPSI) complexes, are 
      emerging as versatile alternatives to phosphine containing palladium complexes 
      for various cross-coupling reactions due to their excellent catalytic activity. 
      Further to mention that NHCs are recently extensively used as ancillary ligands 
      in organometallic chemistry, which includes industrial-related catalytic 
      transformations due to strong σ-donors to metal centres. Apart from this, many 
      NHC-metal complexes are the fascinating consideration in material science as 
      probable metallo-pharmaceuticals. The current review offers a brief exploration

AB  - Plant litter input is an important driver of soil/sediment organic carbon (SOC) 
      turnover. A large number of studies have targeted litter-derived C input tracing 
      at a global level. However, little is known about how litter carbon (C) input via 
      various plant tissues affects SOC accumulation and mineralization. Here, we 
      conducted laboratory incubation to investigate the effects of leaf litter and 
      stem litter input on SOC dynamics using the natural (13)C isotope technique. A 
      122-day laboratory incubation period showed that litter input facilitated SOC 
      accumulation. Leaf and stem litter inputs increased soil total organic carbon 
      content by 37.6% and 15.5%, respectively. Leaf litter input had a higher 
      contribution to SOC accumulation than stem litter input. Throughout the 
      incubation period, the δ(13)C values of stem litter and leaf litter increased by 
      1.5‰ and 3.3‰, respectively, while δ(13)CO(2) derived from stem litter and 
      δ(13)CO(2) derived from leaf litter decreased by 4.2‰ and 6.1‰, respectively, 
      suggesting that the magnitude of δ(13)C in litter and δ(13)CO(2) shifts varied, 
      depending on litter tissues. The cumulative CO(2)-C emissions of leaf litter 
      input treatments were 27.56%-42.47% higher than those of the stem litter input 
      treatments, and thus leaf litter input promoted SOC mineralization more than stem 
      litter input. Moreover, the proportion of increased CO(2)-C emissions to 
      cumulative CO(2)-C emissions (57.18%-92.12%) was greater than the proportion of 
      litter C input to total C (18.7%-36.8%), indicating that litter input could 
      stimulate native SOC mineralization, which offsets litter-derived C in the soil. 
      Overall, litter input caused a net increase in SOC accumulation, but it also 
      accelerated the loss of native SOC. These findings provide a reliable basis for 
      assessing SOC stability and net C sink capacity in wetlands.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in our center, 
      neither prehabilitation nor multimodal rehabilitation could be applied due to the 
      excessive patient load on the health system and to reduce SARS-CoV-2 
      transmission. The objective of our study was to analyze the evolution, 
      complications, and survival up to one year of patients who underwent radical 
      cystectomy in our hospital from March 1st to May 31st, 2020 (period of the first 
      wave COVID-19 pandemic in Spain). We also compared the results with cystectomized 
      patients outside the pandemic period and with application of the ERAS (Enhanced 
      Recovery After Surgery) protocol. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Single-center, 
      retrospective cohort study of patients scheduled for radical cystectomy from 
      March 1st, 2020 to May 31st, 2020. They were matched with previously operated 
      patients using a 1:2 propensity matching score. The matching variables were 
      demographic data, preoperative and intraoperative clinical conditions. RESULTS: A 
      total of 23 radical cystectomies with urinary diversion were performed in the 
      period described. In none of the cases the prehabilitation or the follow-up of 
      our ERAS protocol could be applied, and this was the only difference we found 
      between the 2 groups. Although the minimally invasive approach was more frequent 
      in the pandemic group, the difference was not statistically significant. Three 
      patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during their admission, presenting severe 
      respiratory complications and high in-hospital mortality. Apart from respiratory 
      complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2, we also found statistically significant 
      differences in other postoperative complications. The hospital stay increased by 
      3 days in the pandemic group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent radical 
      cystectomy at our center during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a 
      higher number and severity of respiratory and non-respiratory complications. 
      Discontinuation of the ERAS protocol was the main difference in treatment between 
      groups.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary incontinence (UI) is the involuntary loss of urine. It is 
      highly prevalent in women and has a great biopsychosocial impact. Rehabilitation 
      is established as the first-line treatment, although its use has not been 
      protocolized. OBJECTIVE: To identify which personal risk factors and type of 
      treatment applied are statistically related to patient improvement. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of female 
      patients diagnosed with urinary incontinence who attended the Pelvic Floor 
      Rehabilitation Clinic of the Río Hortega University Hospital, receiving 
      rehabilitation treatment during the year 2021. The minimum follow-up period was 
      12 weeks. The presence or absence of improvement was evaluated according to seven 
      objective and subjective variables, and improvement was established as positive 
      evolution in at least five of the seven variables. RESULTS: A total of 114 women 
      with urinary incontinence were analyzed. The most frequent types of incontinence 
      were stress (53%) and mixed (36%). The most important risk factors and associated 
      pathology were episiotomy (68%), repeated urinary tract infections (61%), and 
      constipation (40.9%). None of these factors showed a statistically significant 
      relationship with patient improvement. The most used rehabilitative treatment was 
      kinesitherapy + biofeedback (51%) which showed a statistically significant 
      relationship with the improvement of these patients (P = .037) together with 
      biofeedback + posterior tibial nerve electrostimulation (PTNS) (P = .044). 
      CONCLUSION: Biofeedback combined with kinesitherapy or PTNS are established as 
      the most effective rehabilitative procedures.

AB  - Emerging evidence points to a positive impact of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 
      (SGLT-2) inhibitors on cardiac structure and function, acutely (as early as 15 
      days) and chronically (up to 2 years). Accordingly, data from clinical studies 
      appear to support the beneficial effects of this class of drugs on the 
      cardiovascular system. However, the extent to which such effects may directly 
      and/or indirectly be responsible for the beneficial actions of this class of 
      drugs remains unclear. Based on the data in the literature, the actions of SGLT-2 
      inhibitors on the cardiac tissue in the absence of SGLT-2 co-transporter sites 
      would suggest possible direct effects on calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II 
      (CaMKII), voltage-gated, Na(v)1.5 channels and sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1), 
      Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHX), the late I(Na) associated with calcium transient, the 
      rapid (I(Kr)) and slow (I(Ks)) delayed rectifier K(+) currents, phosphorylated 
      levels of myofilament regulatory proteins, xanthine oxidase activity and 
      sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase and/or intracellular, and/or possible 
      genomic sites in the cardiac myocytes. Collectively, the experimental and 
      clinical evidence as to the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on cardiac and vascular 
      tissues appear multifaceted in nature with no consensus for definitive site(s) of 
      actions. It is clear that further investigations both in animals and humans, in 
      vitro and in vivo are needed to shed more light on the true nature of the 
      pharmacological actions of this class of compounds, and the extent of their 
      beneficial effects as reported in a population with heart failure.

AB  - Trustworthiness of medical publications can depend on either good faith or 
      verifiable data. Most medical publications to-date have been advertisements, some 
      form of scholarly boasting. The authors practically announce to the world that 
      they did some research. In good faith, other scientists as well as practitioners 
      of medicine, guideline developers, and patients are asked to take these 
      advertisements seriously, buy into them, and make important (occasionally 
      life-or-death) decisions based on what they say. However, the raw data are 
      usually not made available. Other crucial parts that would allow to verify the 
      research, including the code, detailed protocols and statistical analysis plans 
      have also been uncommonly shared - or they may not exist. Under such 
      circumstances, is faith misplaced when one accepts that the work presented is 
      real?

TI  - Targeting UBE2T potentiates gemcitabine efficacy in pancreatic cancer by 
      regulating pyrimidine metabolism and replication stress.
LID - S0016-5085(23)00164-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2023.02.025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although small patient subsets benefit from current targeted 
      strategies or immunotherapy, gemcitabine remains the first-line drug for 
      pancreatic cancer (PC) treatment. However, gemcitabine resistance is widespread 
      and compromises long-term survival. Here, we identified ubiquitin-conjugating 
      enzyme E2T (UBE2T) as a potential therapeutic target to combat gemcitabine 
      resistance in PC. METHODS: Proteomics and metabolomics were combined to examine 
      the effect of UBE2T on pyrimidine metabolism remodeling. Spontaneous PC mice 
      (LSL-Kras(G12D/+), LSL-Trp53(R172H/+), Pdx1-Cre; KPC) with Ube2t-conditional 
      knockout, organoids, and large-scale clinical samples were used to determine the 
      effect of UBE2T on gemcitabine efficacy. Organoids, patient-derived xenografts 
      (PDX), and KPC mice were used to examine the efficacy of the combination of a 
      UBE2T inhibitor and gemcitabine. RESULTS: Spontaneous PC mice with Ube2t deletion 
      had a marked survival advantage following gemcitabine treatment, and UBE2T levels 
      were positively correlated with gemcitabine resistance in clinical patients. 
      Mechanistically, UBE2T catalyzes RING1-mediated ubiquitination of p53 and 
      relieves the transcriptional repression of RRM1 and RRM2, resulting in 
      unrestrained pyrimidine biosynthesis and alleviation of replication stress. 
      Additionally, high-throughput compound library screening using organoids 
      identified pentagalloylglucose (PGG) as a potent UBE2T inhibitor and gemcitabine 
      sensitizer. The combination of gemcitabine and PGG diminished tumor growth in PDX 
      models and prolonged long-term survival in spontaneous PC mice. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Collectively, UBE2T-mediated p53 degradation confers PC gemcitabine resistance by 
      promoting pyrimidine biosynthesis and alleviating replication stress. This study 
      offers an opportunity to improve PC survival by targeting UBE2T and develop a 
      promising gemcitabine sensitizer in clinical translation setting.

TI  - Occupational Exposure to Blood and Body Fluids Among Pre-Hospital Emergency 
      Medical Services Workers in Mashhad, Northeast of Iran.

LID - 10.1016/j.ajic.2023.02.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess occupational exposure to blood and body 
      fluids (BBFs) and the use of protective equipment among pre-hospital emergency 
      medical services (EMS) workers in Mashhad, Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      questionnaire survey-based study was conducted from July 2020 to March 2021 in 
      Mashhad. All pre-hospital EMS workers of Mashhad were invited to participate in 
      the study using the census technique. The questionnaire was about occupational 
      exposure to BBFs, infection control, protective measures, health program, and 
      demographic information. RESULTS: In total, 442 participants answered the 
      questionnaire (response rate: 82.77%). Based on the findings, 420 (95.2%) and 402 
      (91.2%) participants had been exposed to BBFs as pre-hospital EMS workers. 
      Moreover, 31.5% and 38.5% of these exposures were caused by contaminated needles 
      and lancets, respectively. The BBFs incidents have occurred despite 98% of the 
      EMS workers reporting there is a needle safety disposable box in the ambulance. 
      The relationship between awareness of precaution measures after exposure to BBFs 
      and training course completion was significant (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study 
      demonstrated the high prevalence of occupational exposures to BBFs among 
      pre-hospital EMS workers. Considering the significant relationship between the 
      completion of standard precautions courses and awareness of BBFs' post-exposure 
      measures, it is recommended to consider multi-faceted strategies for continuous 
      monitoring, training, and follow-up of pre-hospital EMS workers.

AB  - Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a significant clinical and economic 
      burden on health systems worldwide. Copper alloys have been certified by the US 
      EPA as solid antimicrobial materials, but their effectiveness in reducing HAIs is 
      not well established OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to assess copper 
      surfaces in situ efficacy in reducing healthcare's microbial burden compared to 
      control surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted using 
      three electronic databases: Web of Science, Pubmed, and Scopus, with the keywords 
      "copper" and "surfaces" and "antimicrobial" and "antibacterial" and "infections." 
      Studies from 2010 to 2022 were included. The quality of the studies was 
      independently screened and assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: A 
      total of 56 articles were screened, with eight included in the review and seven, 
      added from references. Two third of the studies report a significant reduction in 
      the microbial burden on copper objects compared to control objects. The two 
      studies with the highest scores on NOS evaluation indicated that using copper or 
      copper alloys in healthcare settings can effectively decrease the number of 
      bacterial contaminations on touch surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the 
      potential effectiveness of copper as a preventive tool in healthcare facilities, 
      but further studies and longer trials are needed to establish a relationship 
      between copper and reduced nosocomial infections.

      reprocessors? Stripped Endoscope model.
LID - S0196-6553(23)00078-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ajic.2023.02.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective drying of the internal channels of endoscopes is essential 
      to prevent the growth of water-borne pathogens and to assure adequate 
      sterilization with vaporized hydrogen peroxide or ethylene oxide. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the dryness of endoscopes after a routine disinfection 
      process in an automated endoscope reprocessor. METHODS: Stripped endoscopes (SE) 
      that allow for visual inspection of the inside channels were reprocessed per 
      protocol in a large urban medical center, with a 3 minute or 10-minute air flush 
      following reprocessing. SE were hung and observed for any water within the 
      channels after reprocessing and after a week of ambient storage. Ready for use 
      endoscopes were also randomly spot checked for moisture visually and with 
      moisture detection paper. RESULTS: All SE were grossly wet after HLD with a 
      3-minute air flush, despite alcohol flush and drying cycle. The 10-minute air 
      flush was effective at drying the biopsy/suction channel, but not the air/water 
      channels. Hanging had limited effect, being most effective in the biopsy/suction 
      channels. Of 77 ready for use respiratory and gastrointestinal endoscopes 
      assessed, 37 (48.1%) showed evidence of retained moisture. CONCLUSIONS: Air flush 
      cycles commonly used in the final steps of automated endoscope reprocessing may 
      not adequately dry endoscope channels, particularly the narrower diameter 
      air/water channels. An extended 10-minute air flush appears effective at drying 
      the larger biopsy/suction channel, but has limited effect on the air/water 
      channels.

AB  - The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene has arguably been the designated 
      pain sensitivity gene for nearly two decades. However, the literature provides 
      inconsistent evidence. We performed several meta-analyses including k = 31 
      samples and n = 4631 participants thereby revealing small effects of rs4680 on 
      pain thresholds in fibromyalgia, headache and across chronic pain conditions. 
      Moreover, rs4680 effects were found across pain patients when affected, but not 
      unaffected, body sites were assessed. No effect was detected for any other SNP 
      investigated. Importantly, our results corroborate earlier findings in that we 
      found a small effect of COMT haplotypes on pain sensitivity. Our review and 
      meta-analysis contribute to the understanding of COMT-dependent effects on pain 
      perception, provide insights into research issues and offer future directions. 
      The results support the theory that rs4680 might only impact behavioural measures 
      of pain when descending pain modulatory pathways are sufficiently challenged. 
      After all, COMT polymorphisms are genetic markers of pain sensitivity, albeit 
      with some limitations which are discussed with respect to their implications for 
      research and clinical significance.

AB  - Salmonella, a foodborne human pathogen, can colonize the members of the kingdom 
      Plantae. However, the basis of the persistence of Salmonella in plants is largely 
      unknown. Plants encounter various biotic and abiotic stress agents in soil. We 
      conjectured that methylglyoxal (MG), one of the common metabolites that 
      accumulate in plants during both biotic and abiotic stress, plays a role in 
      regulating the plant-Salmonella interaction. The interaction of Salmonella 
      Typhimurium with plants under salinity stress was investigated. It was observed 
      that wild-type Salmonella Typhimurium can efficiently colonize the root, but 
      mutant bacteria lacking MG detoxifying enzyme, lactoyl-glutathione lyase (Lgl), 
      showed lower colonization in roots exclusively under salinity stress. This 
      colonization defect is due to the poor viability of the mutated bacterial strains 
      under these conditions. This is the first report to prove the role of 
      MG-detoxification genes in the colonization of stressed plants and highlights the 
      possible involvement of metabolic genes in the evolution of the plant-associated 
      life of Salmonella.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the lifetime cost-effectiveness of 
      increasing home hemodialysis (HHD) as a treatment option for patients 
      experiencing peritoneal dialysis (PD) technique failure compared to the current 
      standard of care. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the lifetime 
      costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness of increasing 
      the usage an integrated home dialysis model compared to the current patient 
      pathways in the UK. A secondary analysis was conducted including only the cost 
      difference in treatments, minimizing the impact of the high cost of dialysis 
      during life years gained (LYG). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed 
      including analyses from a societal rather than a National Health Service (NHS) 
      perspective. RESULTS: The base case probabilistic analysis was associated with 
      incremental costs of £3,413 and QALYs of 0.09, resulting in an incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £36,341. The secondary analysis found the 
      integrated home dialysis model to be dominant. Conclusions on cost-effectiveness 
      did not change under the societal perspective in either analysis. CONCLUSION: The 
      base case analysis found that an integrated home dialysis model compared to 
      current patient pathways is likely not cost-effective. These results were 
      primarily driven by the high baseline costs of dialysis during life-years gained 
      by HHD patients. When excluding baseline dialysis-related treatment costs, the 
      integrated home dialysis model was dominant. New strategies in kidney care 
      patient pathway management should be explored as, under the assumption that 
      dialysis should be funded, the results provide cost-effectiveness evidence for an 
      integrated home dialysis model.

TI  - The associations of prescription drug insurance and cost-sharing with drug use, 
      health services use, and health - a systematic review of Canadian studies.
LID - S1098-3015(23)00059-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2023.02.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Canada, public insurance for physician and hospital services, 
      without cost-sharing, is provided to all residents. Outpatient prescription drug 
      coverage, however, is provided through a patchwork system of public and private 
      plans, often with substantial cost-sharing, which leaves many underinsured or 
      uninsured. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to examine the association 
      of drug insurance and cost-sharing with drug use, health services use, and 
      health, in Canada. We searched four electronic databases, two grey literature 
      databases, five specialty journals and two working paper repositories. At least 
      two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion, extracted 
      characteristics, and assessed risk of bias. RESULTS: The expansion of drug 
      insurance was associated with increases in drug use, individuals who reported 
      drug insurance generally reported higher drug use, and increases in and higher 
      levels of drug cost-sharing were associated with lower drug use. Although a 
      number of studies found statistically significant associations between drug 
      insurance or cost-sharing and health services use, the magnitudes of these 
      associations were generally fairly small. Among five studies that examined the 
      association of drug insurance and cost-sharing with health outcomes, one found a 
      statistically significant and clinically meaningful association. We did not find 
      that socioeconomic status or sex were effect modifiers; there was some evidence 
      that health modified the association between drug insurance and cost-sharing and 
      drug use. CONCLUSIONS: Increased cost-sharing is likely to reduce drug use. 
      Universal pharmacare without cost-sharing may reduce inequities as it would 
      likely increase drug use among lower-income populations relative to higher-income 
      populations.

TI  - Seborrheic dermatitis: topical therapeutics and formulation design.
LID - S0939-6411(23)00029-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejpb.2023.01.023 [doi]
AB  - Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common dermatological disorder with symptoms that 
      include skin flaking, erythema and pruritus. This review discusses the topical 
      products available for treating SD, which target several aspects of disease 
      pathobiology, including cutaneous microbial dysbiosis (driven by Malassezia 
      yeast), inflammation, sebum production and skin barrier disruption. Among the 
      various treatments available, zinc pyrithione (ZnPT) based products that exhibit 
      anti-fungal action are the market leaders. A skin compartment approach is 
      presented here for combining ZnPT exposure information with threshold levels for 
      anti-fungal efficacy and toxicity, overall providing a comprehensive picture of 
      ZnPT therapeutics and safety. While Malassezia yeast on the surface are 
      effectively targeted, yeast residing beyond the superficial follicle may not 
      receive adequate ZnPT for anti-fungal effect and may continue to grow, forming 
      the basis for skin re-colonisation. Levels entering systemic circulation from 
      topical delivery are well below toxic thresholds, however the elevated zinc 
      levels within the viable epidermis warrants further investigation. Strategies to 
      improve formulation design can be broadly classified as influencing 1) topical 
      delivery, 2) therapeutic bioactivity, 3) skin mildness, and 4) sensory 
      attributes. Successful SD treatment ultimately requires formulations that can 
      balance efficacy, safety, and consumer appeal.

AB  - Intranasal administration has attracted increasing attention as a drug delivery 
      approach based on nose-to-brain drug delivery from the nasal cavity to brain 
      tissue directly, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. However, application of the 
      method to poorly water-soluble drugs is potentially limited due to low aqueous 
      solubility and dissolution, which can hinder drug transfer to brain tissue. In 
      the present study, we focused on an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) technique to 
      improve drug dissolution. A carbamazepine-loaded ASD model drug was prepared 
      using the solvent evaporation method (ASD-1). After screening six water-soluble 
      polymer carriers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based ASD-1 formulation exhibited the 
      most rapid and highest drug dissolution under experimental conditions in the 
      nasal cavity (pH 6.0). A carbamazepine suspension dispersed with a PVA-ASD-1 
      formulation exhibited enhanced drug delivery into plasma and brain tissue of rats 
      in vivo. A spray-dried powder formulation of PVA-ASD (PVA-ASD-2) exhibited 
      improved drug dissolution and in vivo drug transfer. Our key finding is that the 
      spray-dried PVA-ASD-2 formulation exhibited higher brain/plasma ratios than the 
      PVA-ASD-1 suspension formulation. Our physical characterization data and 
      demonstration of improved drug transfer suggest that ASD-based intranasal 
      formulations hold promise for drug delivery to the brain.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Uncaria rhynchophylla ([Mi] Jack) (gouteng) 
      exerts antidepressive effects. Rhynchophylline (RH), a major component of U. 
      rhynchophylla, exerts similar pharmacological effects to those of gouteng. Thus, 
      RH may have antidepressive effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the 
      anti-depressive effects of RH in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced 
      depressive mice. The anti-depressive mechanism of RH determined by measuring the 
      5-HT levels, the expressions of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in cortex and hippocampus. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The behaviors of CUMS-induced depressive mice were measured using an 
      open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), and tail suspension test 
      (TST). 5-HT levels were measured using an ELISA kits. The expressions of BDNF and 
      CREB were determined using western blot test. RESULTS: RH increased the frequency 
      of rearing and grooming in the OFT and decreased the immobility time in the FST 
      and TST. RH effectively increased the 5-HT level and BDNF and CREB expressions in 
      the cortex and hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the 
      antidepressive mechanism of RH is related to increased levels of 5-HT from 
      regulating CREB and BDNF expressions in cortex and hippocampus.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Curcumae Longae Rhizoma (CLR) is a safe natural 
      herbal medicine, and which has been widely used for centuries as functional food 
      and health products, but its effects on angiogenesis and related underlying 
      mechanism remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The abnormal angiogenesis is closely 
      related with various diseases, and therefore the precise control of angiogenesis 
      is of great importance. The well-known angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial 
      growth factor (VEGF), mediates angiogenesis and induces multiple signalling 
      pathways via binding to VEGF receptor (VEGFR). The attenuation of VEGF-triggered 
      angiogenic-related signalling pathways may relieve various diseases through 
      suppression of angiogenesis. Here, we aimed to elucidate that CLR extract could 
      exert striking anti-angiogenic activities both in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: The viability of human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC) 
      was examined by LDH and MTT assays. Migrative and invasive ability of the 
      endothelial cells were independently evaluated by wound healing and transwell 
      assays. The activities of CLR extract on in vitro angiogenesis was tested by tube 
      formation assay. In vivo vascularization was determined by using zebrafish embryo 
      model in the present of CLR extract. Western blotting was applied to determine 
      the phosphorylated levels of VEGFR2, PI3K, AKT and eNOS. Besides, the levels of 
      nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were separately evaluated by 
      Griess assay and 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate reaction. In addition, the 
      cell migrative ability of cancer cell was estimated by using cultured human colon 
      carcinoma cells (HT-29 cell line), and immunofluorescence assay was applied to 
      evaluate the effect of CLR extract on nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit 
      in the VEGF-treated HT-29 cultures. RESULTS: CLR extract significantly suppressed 
      a series of VEGF-mediated angiogenic responses, including endothelial cell 
      proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation. Moreover, CLR extract 
      reduced in vivo sub-intestinal vessel formation in zebrafish embryo model. 
      Mechanistically, the extract of CLR attenuated the VEGF-triggered signalling, as 
      demonstrated by decreased level of phosphorylated VEGFR2 and subsequently 
      inactivated its downstream regulators, e.g. phospho-PI3K, phospho-AKT and 
      phospho-eNOS. The production of NO and formation of ROS were markedly inhibited 
      in HUVECs. Furthermore, CLR extract suppressed cell migration and NF-κB 
      translocation in cultured HT-29 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical findings 
      demonstrate that the extract of CLR remarkably attenuates angiogenesis and which 
      has great potential as a natural drug candidate with excellent anti-angiogenic 
      activity.

TI  - The attenuation effect of licorice on the hepatotoxicity of Euodiae Fructus by 
      inhibiting the formation of protein conjugates and GSH depletion.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: As a traditional Chinese medicine and food, 
      Euodiae Fructus (EF) is widely used in clinics to relieve pain and prevent 
      vomiting and for making tea for more than a thousand years. In recent years, 
      hepatotoxic reactions to EF have been reported. The intermediates produced by 
      evodiamine and rutaecarpine metabolism in vitro were captured by glutathione 
      (GSH), suggesting that the toxicity of EF may be related to metabolic activation. 
      Whether licorice can inhibit the metabolic activation of EF has not been 
      reported, which needed an effective strategy to clarify the correlation between 
      protein conjugates and hepatotoxicity and the attenuation mechanism of licorice 
      processing. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to explore the toxic components 
      and mechanisms of EF based on metabolic activation and the detoxification of 
      licorice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The content and toxicity index of protein 
      conjugates in the liver were determined by orally administering mice and rats 
      with EF. The attenuation mechanism of licorice was examined in cell and 
      enzymology experiments. RESULTS: The change in evodiamine-cysteinylglycine 
      (EVO-Cys-Gly) and evodiamine-cysteine (EVO-Cys) levels was consistent with the 
      change in hepatotoxicity. Licorice inhibited the formation of the protein 
      conjugates of EF and increased the content of GSH in L02 cells. CONCLUSION: EF 
      mediated by P450 enzymes produced toxic intermediates, which combined with 
      cysteine residues in animal liver and inactivate them, leading to hepatotoxicity. 
      Interestingly, licorice can alleviate the GSH depletion caused by EF and inhibit 
      the production of protein conjugates by inhibiting P450 enzymes.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is the principal 
      bioactive compound isolated from the plant Carthamus tinctorius L. and has been 
      reported to exert neuroprotective effects against various neurological diseases, 
      including traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the specific molecular and 
      cellular mechanisms underlying HSYA-mediated neuroprotection against TBI are 
      unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study explored the effects of HSYA on autophagy 
      and the NLRP3 inflammasome in mice with TBI and the related mechanisms. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Mice were subjected to TBI and treated with or without HSYA. 
      Neurological severity scoring, LDH assays and apoptosis detection were first 
      performed to assess the effects of HSYA in mice with TBI. RNA-seq was then 
      conducted to explore the mechanisms that contributed to HSYA-mediated 
      neuroprotection. ELISA, western blotting, and immunofluorescence were performed 
      to further investigate the mechanisms of neuroinflammation and autophagy. 
      Moreover, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, was applied to 
      determine the connection between autophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome. RESULTS: 
      HSYA significantly decreased the neurological severity score, serum LDH levels 
      and apoptosis in mice with TBI. A total of 921 differentially expressed genes 
      were identified in the cortices of HSYA-treated mice with TBI and were 
      significantly enriched in the inflammatory response and autophagy. Furthermore, 
      HSYA treatment markedly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and astrocyte 
      activation. Importantly, HSYA suppressed neuronal NLRP3 inflammasome activation, 
      as indicated by decreased levels of NLRP3, ASC and cleaved caspase-1 and a 
      reduced NLRP3(+) neuron number. It increased autophagy and ameliorated autophagic 
      flux dysfunction, as evidenced by increased LC3 II/LC3 I levels and decreased P62 
      levels. The effects of HSYA on the NLRP3 inflammasome were abolished by 3-MA. 
      Mechanistically, HSYA may enhance autophagy through AMPK/mTOR signalling. 
      CONCLUSION: HSYA enhanced neuronal autophagy by triggering the AMPK/mTOR 
      signalling pathway, leading to inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome to improve 
      neurological recovery after TBI.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Yiyi Fuzi Baijiang formula (YFB) is a traditional 
      Chinese medicine prescription composed of Coix seed, Radix Aconiti Lateralis and 
      Patrinia villosa, which has been used to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) for 
      thousands of years. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the therapeutic effect and 
      metabolic analysis of YFB formula on UC in rats induced by 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene 
      sulfonic acid (TNBS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six main alkaloids in the YFB 
      formula were determined by UPLC‒MS/MS. The rat UC model was induced by TNBS, and 
      the therapeutic effect of YFB formula on UC was evaluated by disease activity 
      index (DAI) score and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. UPLC-QTRAP-MS metabolomics 
      technology was used to screen potential biomarkers for YFB treatment of UC in 
      combination with multivariate data statistics and further analyze related 
      metabolic pathways. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of 
      NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, ASC, pro-caspase1 and Caspase-1 in rat liver tissues. ELISA 
      and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the contents of interleukin 
      (IL)-17A, IL-21, IL-22, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-18 in rat serum and liver 
      tissues. RESULTS: The DAI scores of the YFB groups were significantly reduced, 
      and colon tissue injury was significantly improved (p < 0.01). The results of 
      metabolomics analysis revealed 29 potential biomarkers in serum and 27 potential 
      biomarkers in liver. YFB formula can treat UC by affecting glycerophospholipid 
      metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid 
      metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism. Compared with the model group, 
      the contents of IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-18 in the YFB 
      groups were decreased in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Compared with those 
      in the model group, the protein levels of NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, ASC, pro-caspase1 
      and Caspase-1 in the YFB groups were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent 
      manner (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of YFB formula on UC rats 
      was dose dependent, and the effect of the YFB (2.046 g/kg) group was close to 
      that of the positive group. YFB formula has an anti-inflammatory effect on UC by 
      regulating the balance of Th17/Treg cells in rats.

AB  - Outbreaks of New Castle Disease from three north eastern states of India were 
      confirmed by clinico-pathological examination followed by reverse 
      transcription-PCR detection of F gene of ND Virus (NDV). Irrespective of 
      vaccination, the outbreaks resulted 90-100% mortality in the affected flocks. The 
      analysis of fusion protein sequences from ten field isolates revealed them as the 
      velogenic or highly virulent strain. Phylogenetic analyses based on the complete 
      F gene nucleotide sequences of the isolates have characterized only one of the 
      isolate (OK149201) in the genotype XIII.2.2. The rest of the nine isolates are 
      depicted in a distinct monophyletic group with average nucleotide distances from 
      the other 20 genotypes ranged from 10.90 - 20.70. The nine isolates were further 
      divided into two sub branches with the bootstrap support value of 100% at the 
      nodes that define the two subgroups with an average evolutionary nucleotide 
      distance of 6.00between the isolates in the two subgroups. As per the 
      recommendation put forth in recently updated unified phylogenetic classification 
      system for NDV, our findings clearly indicates emergence of a novel genotype of 
      class II NDV in the biodiversity hot spot region of NER, India. The isolates in 
      the newly identified genotype is designated with next available Roman numerals 
      XXII. Further, the two subgroups within the genotype are designated as XXII.1 and 
      XXII.2.

AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has been linked to numerous poor 
      neurological outcomes as well as impairments in respiratory neural control. 
      Females are known to metabolize ethanol (EtOH) differently than males suggesting 
      a sexual dimorphic sensitivity to EtOH exposure. We used a rodent model of FASD 
      to investigate whether EtOH disrupts respiratory neural control. Rat pups 
      received a single intraperitoneal injection of 2 different doses (0.8 mg/g or 
      4.4 mg/g) of EtOH. Whole-body plethysmography was used ∼24 h later to assess 
      ventilatory responses to acute hypoxia (HVR) and hypercapnia (HCVR). Females 
      treated with 4.4 mg/g of EtOH exhibited an attenuated HVR and HCVR, but there was 
      no effect on males, and no effect of 0.8 mg/g on either sex. There was unexpected 
      mortality of unknown causes, especially in females, that occurred 2-3 days after 
      EtOH administration. These data suggest that important ventilatory defense 
      responses in females are impaired following developmental EtOH exposure, and this 
      may be associated with increased risk of later death.

AB  - To clarify the role of oestrogen signalling and the role of oestrogen receptor 
      alpha (ERα) in the cough pathways we performed a study in which coughing was 
      observed in both sexes animal models after the treatment by selective ERα 
      degrader fulvestrant (ICI 182-780) and inhibitor of oestrogen synthesis danazol. 
      Degradation of ERα with the normal plasma oestrogen levels induced by 
      fulvestrant, significantly augments the cough response of female but not male 
      guinea pigs. These changes were observed in citric acid-induced cough. Female 
      guinea pigs responded with an increased count of cough expulsions per challenge 
      time and we also detected shorter cough latency. The capsaicin-induced cough did 
      not change. A similar response was observed after danazol treatment, which 
      decreased the plasma oestrogen level. Our results indicate that the transient 
      receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channel-mediated cough is resistant to the 
      hypoestrous state, while the citric acid-mediated cough is oestrogen-dependent 
      and hypersensitive during the hypoestrous state.

AB  - 3D models of airway lumens were created from CT scans of 19 patients with 
      laryngotracheal stenosis. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were 
      completed for each, and results were compared to measured peak inspiratory flow 
      rate, grade of lumen constriction, and measures of airway geometry. Results 
      demonstrate flow resistance and shear stress correlate with degree of lumen 
      constriction and absolute cross-sectional area as well as flow rate. Flow 
      recirculation depends on airway constriction but does not vary with flow rate. 
      Resistance and wall shear stress did not correlate well with functional measures. 
      Flow recirculation did differ between subjects with higher functional measures 
      and subjects with lower functional measures. This analysis provides mathematical 
      models to predict airway resistance, wall shear stress, and flow reversal 
      according lumen constriction and inspiratory flow rate. It suggests aerodynamic 
      factors such as flow recirculation play a role in differences in functional 
      performance between patients with similar airway measures.

AB  - AIM: To describe the knowledge and opinion of health professionals regarding the 
      usefulness of radiomics in oncology. METHODS: A 12-question questionnaire 
      (multiple-choice responses, Likert-type scale, and open response) was developed 
      and sent to professionals related to diagnosis/treatment of oncological diseases 
      (Oncology, Radiodiagnosis, Nuclear Medicine, Radiation Oncology, 
      Hematology-Oncology, Radiophysics and Pathology). Participants were classified 
      into two groups according to their level of training: attending physicians and 
      residents. RESULTS: 114 professionals completed the survey (54% residents, mostly 
      from Nuclear Medicine and Radiodiagnostic specialties). Attending physicians 
      obtained a better performance in the area pf knowledge compared to residents. 
      Both groups of respondents agreed regarding the usefulness of radiomics to help 
      make more accurate diagnoses and promoting the work of medical teams and the most 
      frequent disadvantages were related to the lack of systematization in the 
      acquisition of images and extraction of parameters, the need for the training of 
      professionals and concern about the replacement of human work by technological 
      tools. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics is a novel field and the most general aspects are 
      known by health professionals. The professionals surveyed were optimistic about 
      the benefits provided by radiomics and other types of tools. The main problem 
      detected was the lack of systematization in its implementation. The replacement 
      of professionals and job loss is a concern, albeit less prevalent, and may 
      respond to a generational phenomenon.

AB  - Camellia (Theaceae) is a morphologically highly diverse genus of flowering plants 
      and includes many famous species with high economic value, and the phylogeny of 
      this genus is not fully resolved. We used 95 transcriptomes from 87 Camellia 
      species and identified 1481 low-copy genes to conduct a detailed analysis of the 
      phylogeny of this genus according to various data-screening criteria. The results 
      show that, very different from the two existing classification systems of 
      Camellia, 87 species are grouped into 8 main clades and two independent species, 
      and that all 8 clades except Clade 8 were strongly supported by almost all the 
      coalescent or concatenated trees using different gene subsets. However, the 
      relationships among these clades were weakly supported and different from 
      analyses using different gene subsets; furthermore, they do not agree with the 
      phylogeny from chloroplast genomes of Camellia. Additional analyses support 
      reticulate evolution (probably resulting from introgression or hybridization) 
      among some major Camellia lineages, providing explanation for extensive gene tree 
      conflicts. Furthermore, we inferred that together with the formation of East 
      Asian subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests, Camellia underwent a radiative 
      divergence of major clades at 23 ∼ 19 Ma in the late Miocene then had a 
      subsequent species burst at 10 ∼ 5 Ma. Principal component and cluster analyses 
      provides new insights into morphological changes underlying the evolution of 
      Camellia and a reference to further clarify subgenus and sections of this genus. 
      The comprehensive study here including a nuclear phylogeny and other analyses 
      reveal the rapid evolutionary history of Camellia.

AB  - Baculoviruses are capable to acquire insect host transposable elements (TEs) in 
      their genomes and are hypothesized as possible vectors of insect transposons 
      between Lepidopteran species. Here, we investigated the host origin of two TEs, 
      namely the Tc1/mariner-like element TCp3.2 and a 0.7 kbp insertion sequence 
      (IS07), found in the genome of different isolates of Cydia pomonella granulovirus 
      (CpGV), a member of the Betabaculovirus genus. The sequences of both TEs were 
      searched for in the full genome sequence database of codling moth (CM, Cydia 
      pomonella L.). A total of eleven TCp3.2 TE copies and 76 copies of the IS07 
      fragments were identified in the CM genome. These TEs were distributed over the 
      22 autosomes and the Z chromosome (chr1) of CM, except chr6, chr12, chr16, chr23, 
      chr27 and the W chromosome (chr29). TCp3.2 copies with two transposase genes in 
      opposite direction, representing a novel feature, were identified on chr10 and 
      chr18. The TCp3.2 transposase was characterized by DD41D motif of classic 
      Tc1/mariner transposons, consisting of DNA-binding domain, catalytic domain and 
      nuclear localization signal (NLS). Transcription analyses of uninfected and 
      CpGV-infected CM larvae suggested a doubling of the TCp3.2 transposase 
      transcription rate in virus infected larvae. Furthermore, IS07 insertion into the 
      CpGV genome apparently added new transcription initiation sites to the viral 
      genome. The global analysis of the distribution of two TEs in the genome of CM 
      addressed the influx of mobile TEs from CM to CpGV, a genetic process that 
      contributes to the population diversity of baculoviruses.

AB  - RATIONALE: Flask-shaped invaginations of the cardiomyocyte sarcolemma called 
      caveolae require the structural protein caveolin-3 (Cav-3) and host a variety of 
      ion channels, transporters, and signaling molecules. Reduced Cav-3 expression has 
      been reported in models of heart failure, and variants in CAV3 have been 
      associated with the inherited long-QT arrhythmia syndrome. Yet, it remains 
      unclear whether alterations in Cav-3 levels alone are sufficient to drive 
      aberrant repolarization and increased arrhythmia risk. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      the impact of cardiac-specific Cav-3 ablation on the electrophysiological 
      properties of the adult mouse heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac-specific, 
      inducible Cav3 homozygous knockout (Cav-3KO) mice demonstrated a marked reduction 
      in Cav-3 expression by Western blot and loss of caveolae by electron microscopy. 
      However, there was no change in macroscopic cardiac structure or contractile 
      function. The QT(c) interval was increased in Cav-3KO mice, and there was an 
      increased propensity for ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular myocytes isolated 
      from Cav-3KO mice exhibited a prolonged action potential duration (APD) that was 
      due to reductions in outward potassium currents (I(to), I(ss)) and changes in 
      inward currents including slowed inactivation of I(Ca,L) and increased I(Na,L). 
      Mathematical modeling demonstrated that the changes in the studied ionic currents 
      were adequate to explain the prolongation of the mouse ventricular action 
      potential. Results from human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes showed that shRNA 
      knockdown of Cav-3 similarly prolonged APD. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that Cav-3 
      and caveolae regulate cardiac repolarization and arrhythmia risk via the 
      integrated modulation of multiple ionic currents.

TI  - Acute ostracism-related pain sensitization in the context of accumulated lifetime 
      experiences of ostracism.

AB  - Ostracism (i.e., being ignored/ excluded) is a form of social adversity that 
      powerfully impacts health and well-being. While laboratory research indicates 
      that experimentally manipulated experiences of ostracism impact pain, findings 
      have been mixed. Prior investigations have not considered moderating or main 
      effects of individual histories of ostracism, and have been limited in the scope 
      of their pain testing. In this study, participants without current pain reported 
      lifetime experiences of ostracism prior to a laboratory visit where they were 
      randomized to experience either a single episode of ostracism (i.e., acute 
      ostracism) or control condition that was immediately followed by quantitative 
      sensory testing. Results indicate that the experimental effect of a single 
      episode of ostracism on pain ratings, after-sensations, and temporal summation of 
      pain is moderated by lifetime ostracism; no main effects were found. For 
      individuals with histories of more lifetime ostracism, encountering a single 
      episode of ostracism led to greater pain sensitization relative to the control 
      condition, whereas no experimental effect was observed for individuals with 
      little lifetime exposure to ostracism. These findings indicate that acute 
      experiences of ostracism may be accompanied by periods of hyperalgesia for people 
      who are chronically ostracized, implicating ostracism as a potential social 
      moderator of pain sensitization. People who are stigmatized may therefore 
      experience enhanced pain burden with repeated and accumulating experiences of 
      ostracism. Perspective: Results suggest that in the context of accumulated 
      lifetime experiences of ostracism, single experiences of ostracism evoke central 
      sensitization. In this way, ostracism may function to trigger central 
      sensitization and shape socially and societally-determined patterns of pain 
      burden and disparity.

AB  - The n-BuOH extract from the herb of Solanum lyratum Thunb. (Solanaceae) was 
      purified by various chromatographic methods, which led to the isolation of seven 
      undescribed alkaloids ((-)-(7'S)-N-feruloyltyramine A, 
      (+)-(7'R)-N-feruloyltyramine A, (+)-(7'S)-N-solanamide A, (-)-(7'R)-N-solanamide 
      A, 7'S-perillascens, solanpyrrole A, and (Z)-asmurratetra A) and 13 known 
      alkaloids, including four pairs of enantiomers. Extensive spectroscopic data and 
      electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations were applied to determine the 
      structures of the undescribed compounds. In in vitro biological activity assays, 
      (-)-(7'S)-N-feruloyltyramine A and (+)-(7'R)-N-feruloyltyramine A exhibited 
      pronounced neuroprotective effects against SH-SY5Y cell damage with survival 
      rates of 75.98% and 76.61%, respectively, at 50 μM. Additionally, 
      (-)-(7'S)-N-feruloyltyramine A and N-cis-feruloyl-3'-methoxy-tyramine displayed 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory effects with IC(50) values of 
      7.41 ± 1.76 μM and 9.21 ± 0.89 μM, respectively. Molecular docking simulations 
      revealed that (-)-(7'S)-N-feruloyltyramine A had a binding site for AChE. These 
      findings reveal the structural diversity of the bioactive compounds in S. lyratum 
      and provides insights into the use of this information for the production of 
      functional components in the pharmaceutical industry.

AB  - The liver is the most important organ in the body. Hepatocyte oxidative damage 
      occurs to excess ROS. Liver fibrosis is a mechanism that the immune system uses 
      to treat extreme inflammation by repairing damaged tissue with the creation of a 
      scar. The outcome of fibrosis may be reversed by consuming natural plant extracts 
      with high ROS-scavenging ability. The date palm fruits contain caffeic acid, 
      gallic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, which have anti-inflammatory, 
      antioxidant, and hepatoprotective properties. This study aimed to prepare a date 
      fruit extract, load it onto chitosan nanoparticles, and compare its anti-fibrotic 
      activity with the unloaded crude extract in the CCl(4)-mouse model. Our findings 
      show that nanocomposite (Cs@FA/DEx) has anti-fibrotic properties and can improve 
      liver function enzymes and endogenous antioxidant enzymes by inhibiting cell 
      apoptosis caused by CCl(4)-induction in mice. Furthermore, significantly reduced 
      CD95 and ICAM1 levels and down-regulation of TGFβ-1 and collagen-α-1 expression 
      demonstrated the anti-fibrotic effects of the Cs@FA/DEx. Therefore, the Cs@FA/DEx 
      might be an innovative supplement for inhibiting liver fibrosis and hepatocyte 
      inflammation induced by chemical toxins. Besides, this nano-supplement could be a 
      promising anti-hepatocellular carcinoma agent as it has potent in vitro 
      anticancer activity against the HePG2 cell line.

AB  - TMEM16A, a Ca(2+)-activated chloride channel (CaCC), and its pharmacological 
      inhibitors can inhibit the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells. However,the poor 
      efficacy, safety, and stability of TMEM16A inhibitors limit the development of 
      these agents. Therefore, finding new therapeutic directions from already marketed 
      drugs is a feasible strategy to obtain safe and effective therapeutic drugs. 
      Here, we screened a library contain more than 2400 FDA, EMA, and NMPA-approved 
      drugs through virtual screening. We identified a drug candidate, candesartan 
      (CDST), which showed strong inhibitory effect on the TMEM16A in a 
      concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) of 24.40 ± 3.21 μM. In addition, 
      CDST inhibited proliferation, migration and induced apoptosis of LA795 cells 
      targeting TMEM16A, and significantly inhibited lung adenocarcinoma tumor growth 
      in vivo. The molecular mechanism of CDST inhibiting TMEM16A channel indicated it 
      bound to R515/R535/E623/E624 in the drug pocket, thereby blocked the pore. In 
      conclusion, we identified a novel TMEM16A channel inhibitor, CDST, which 
      exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against lung adenocarcinoma. Considering 
      that CDST has been used in clinical treatment of hypertension, it may play an 
      important role in the combined treatment of hypertension and lung adenocarcinoma 
      as a multi-target drug in the future.

AB  - A novel quinazoli-4-one based ionic liquid, 
      1-(3-aminopropyl)-3-methyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-1-ium bromide (QIL) for 
      fluorometric determination of dissolved ammonia has been successfully synthesized 
      and characterized by spectroscopic techniques such as (1)H and (13)C NMR, FTIR 
      and HRMS spectrometry. In the proposed method, QIL is converted to a fluorescent 
      derivative by the reaction with ammonia in aqueous medium. The excitation and 
      emission wavelengths were 250 and 436 nm, respectively. Remarkably with the 
      reaction time of >1 s, the binding constant and detection limit was found to be 
      6.43 × 10(8) M(-1) and 0.73 × 10(-8) M, respectively. QIL is found to be highly 
      selective as no interference is observed from various cations, anions, organic 
      molecules and amino acids. The sensing mechanism was further validated by the 
      density functional theory studies. The fluorophore exhibited great sensing 
      property in 3.0-14.0 pH range, hence, it can be employed in diverse matrices. In 
      addition, the fluoro-sensor is highly reversible and reusable in the presence of 
      ctDNA molecule. Moreover, a live-cell imaging study of QIL in Drosophila larval 
      gut tissue has also been carried out to investigate the cell permeability of QIL 
      and its efficiency for selective detection of NH(3) in cellular micro 
      environment. To show practical applicability of the fluoro-sensor, test strip kit 
      has been constructed. A detailed comparison table has been shown to evaluate the 
      efficiency of this method.

AB  - In recent years, the unprecedented increase in various cancers such as melanoma 
      has caused researchers to focus more on the formulation of newer drugs with less 
      side effects. In this study, we herein indicate the biogenic nanoarchitechtonics 
      of Ag NPs template over chitosan/starch mixed hydrogel having notable reducing 
      potential and anti-malignant melanoma effects. The two biopolymers also could 
      stabilize as-synthesized Ag NPs. Physicochemical features of the material were 
      further characterized over a range of advanced methods like X-ray diffraction 
      (XRD), elemental mapping, dynamic light scattering (DLS), energy-dispersive X-ray 
      spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission 
      scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and Fourier transformed infrared 
      spectroscopy (FT-IR). TEM analysis showed the spherical-shaped nanocomposite with 
      the mean diameter in the range of 5-15 nm. Thereafter, the nanocomposite was 
      exploited in the anti-malignant melanoma and cytotoxicity effects studies against 
      various human malignant melanoma cell lines (HT144, RPMI7951, SKMEL2, UACC3074, 
      WM266-4 and MUM2C) in situ. The bio-composite corresponding IC(50) values were 
      193, 102, 227, 250, 301, and 203 μg/mL against MUM2C, WM266-4, UACC3074, SKMEL2, 
      RPMI7951, and HT144 cell lines, respectively. A significantly high IC(50) value 
      offered an excellent antioxidant capacity of bio-composite. According to the 
      above results, Ag NPs/CS-Starch nanomaterial can be utilized as an efficient drug 
      to treat malignant melanoma in humans after doing clinical trial studies.

AB  - Spermatogenesis refers to the differentiation of the spermatogonial stem cells 
      (SSCs) located in the base seminiferous tubules into haploid spermatozoa. 
      Prerequisites for in vitro spermatogenesis include an extracellular matrix (ECM), 
      paracrine factors, and testicular somatic cells which play a supporting role for 
      SSCs. Thus, the present study evaluated the potential of co-culturing Sertoli 
      cells and SSCs embedded in a hybrid hydrogel of agarose and laminin, the main 
      components of the ECM. Following the three-week conventional culture of human 
      testicular cells, the cells were cultured in agarose hydrogel or agarose/laminin 
      one (hybrid) for 74 days. Then, immunocytochemistry, real-time PCR, electron 
      microscopy, and morphological staining methods were applied to analyze the 
      presence of SSCs, as well as the other cells of the different stages of 
      spermatogenesis. Based on the results, the colonies with positive spermatogenesis 
      markers were observed in both culture systems. The existence of the cells of all 
      three phases of spermatogenesis (spermatogonia, meiosis, and spermiogenesis) was 
      confirmed in the two groups, while morphological spermatozoa were detected only 
      in the hybrid hydrogel group. Finally, a biologically improved 3D matrix can 
      support all the physiological activities of SSCs such as survival, proliferation, 
      and differentiation.

AB  - The pea starch-gallic acid (PS-GA) complexes were prepared using high pressure 
      homogenization (HPH), then the effect and underlying mechanism of pressure on 
      multi-scale structure and digestibility of complexes were investigated. Results 
      showed that HPH promoted the formation of PS-GA complexes, reaching the maximum 
      complex index of 7.74 % at the pressure of 90 MPa, and the main driving force 
      were hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The interaction between PS 
      and GA facilitated the formation of surface reticular structures to encapsulate 
      gallic acid molecules, further entangled into bigger size aggregates. The 
      enhancement of rearrangement and aggregation of starch chains during HPH 
      developed a dense hierarchical structure of PS-GA complexes, including 
      short-range ordered structure, V-type crystal structure, lamellar and fractal 
      structure, thus increasing gelatinization temperature. The digestibility of PS-GA 
      complexes substantially changed in reducing rapidly digestible starch content 
      from 29.67 % to 17.07 %, increasing slowly digestible starch from 53.69 % to 
      56.25 % and resistant starch from 16.63 % to 26.67 %, respectively. Moreover, the 
      resulting complexes exhibited slower digestion rates compared with native PS. 
      Furthermore, the regulating mechanism of pressure during HPH on starch 
      digestibility was the formation of ordered multi-scale structure and inhibition 
      of GA on digestive enzymes.

AB  - The effects of nitrogen (N) fertilizer on endosperm development, starch 
      component, key enzyme activity and grain quality of common buckwheat were 
      investigated in this study. The results showed that N fertilization significantly 
      enhanced the number and area of endosperm cells, and significant increases were 
      also observed in the contents of amylose, amylopectin and total starch. With 
      increasing N level, the activities of key enzyme significantly increased showing 
      the maximum under the N(2) level (180 kg N ha(-1)), and then decreased under high 
      N level. As N level increased, the ash, crude protein and amylose content varied 
      from 1.36 to 2.25 %, from 7.99 to 15.84 % and from 22.69 to 27.64 %, 
      respectively. The gelatinization enthalpy significantly increased with the range 
      of 3.46-5.66 J/g, while no change was found in crystalline structure of common 
      buckwheat flour. These results indicated that appropriate N application could 
      effectively improve the endosperm development, starch synthesis and accumulation, 
      and grain properties of common buckwheat, with the best effect under the level of 
      180 kg N ha(-1).

AB  - Protection coatings with self-healing ability can significantly enhance their 
      anti-corrosion properties and service life. In this study, self-healing 
      waterborne polyurethane (WPU) coatings with high transparence and haze were 
      facile fabricated via cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) stabilized linseed oil (LO) 
      Pickering emulsion. Sustainable CNCs displayed outstanding emulsifying ability 
      and stability to stabilize LO Pickering emulsion. The size of LO Pickering 
      emulsion droplets decreases with the CNC concentration, while the emulsion 
      fraction and surface coverage by CNCs increase with CNC concentration, leading to 
      a more stable Pickering emulsion. The self-healing rates of WPU coatings at 
      varied time, temperature, CNC and catalyst concentration were investigated. 
      Higher temperature, larger emulsion droplets, and with driers employed as 
      catalysts generally lead to faster self-healing rate. The WPU self-healing 
      coatings displayed much better abrasion resistance and mechanical properties than 
      pristine WPU due to the incorporation of CNCs. Moreover, the WPU self-healing 
      coatings show a high transparence and haze due to light scattering, and their 
      applications as coatings of lamp covers and glass to achieve uniform light 
      distribution and privacy protection with high light transmission were further 
      demonstrated.

AB  - In this study, the various ratio of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) to 
      lecithin (LEC) was 0:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, 1.5:1 and 2:1 (w/w) co-stabilized cinnamon 
      essential oil (CEO) nanoemulsions were prepared. These nanoemulsions were 
      successfully incorporated in the konjac glucomannan/pullulan 
      polysaccharides-based film matrix. The composition of nanoemulsions and the 
      effect of various nanoemulsions on rheological, mechanical, Water vapor 
      permeability, optical, color, morphology properties, and CEO retention rate of 
      the composite films were characterized. The results demonstrated that HPCD and 
      LEC nanoemulsions had small particle size under 120 nm and high stability during 
      21 days storage, the incorporation of nanoemulsions reduced the viscosity of 
      film-solution, transmittance, Water vapor permeability and mechanical properties 
      of films, but an appropriate HPCD content 1:1 w/w of nanoemulsions could restored 
      the mechanical properties of the films. Otherwise, 1:1 w/w of nanoemulsion film 
      also exhibited a more compact and uniform structure, Furthermore, 2:1 w/w of 
      nanoemulsion films with high retention rate of CEO, and the antioxidant and 
      better antibacterial activities against E. coli and S. aureus. The nanoemulsion 
      films utilized in this study also prolonged the shelf life of Agaricus bisporus 
      mushrooms and cherries while maintaining their commercial value.

AB  - c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation is widely observed during virus 
      infection, modulating various aspects of the virus-host interaction. In our 
      previous research, we have proved that B. mori ferritin heavy-chain homolog 
      (BmFerHCH), an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS), facilitates B. mori 
      nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) proliferation. However, one question remains: Which 
      downstream signaling pathways does BmFerHCH regulate by inhibiting ROS? Here, we 
      first determined that silencing BmFerHCH inhibits BmNPV proliferation, and this 
      inhibition depends on ROS. Then, we substantiated that BmNPV infection activates 
      the JNK signaling pathway. Interestingly, the JNK phosphorylation during BmNPV 
      infection is activated by ROS. Further, we found that the enhanced nuclear 
      translocation of phospho-JNK induced by BmNPV infection was dramatically reduced 
      by pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), whereas there was 
      more detectable phospho-JNK in the cytoplasm. Next, we investigated how changes 
      in BmFerHCH expression affect JNK phosphorylation. BmFerHCH overexpression 
      suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK and nuclear translocation of phospho-JNK 
      during BmNPV infection, whereas BmFerHCH knockdown facilitated phosphorylation of 
      JNK and nuclear translocation of phospho-JNK. By measuring the viral load, we 
      found the inhibitory effect of BmFerHCH knockdown on BmNPV infection depends on 
      phosphorylated JNK. In addition, the JNK signaling pathway was involved in 
      BmNPV-triggered apoptosis. Hence, we hypothesize that ROS-mediated JNK 
      phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of BmFerHCH on BmNPV proliferation. 
      These results elucidate the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of 
      BmFerHCH-mediated response to BmNPV infection.

AB  - Requirements for sustainable development have led to the urgent need for low 
      cost, green, and reproducible resources. Lignin is one of the resources meeting 
      this requirement. Herein, an alkali lignin (AL)-Fe(3+)-H(2)O(2) autocatalytic 
      system was introduced to assemble multifunctional AL-Fe(3+)/polyacrylic acid 
      (PAA) hydrogels. The AL-Fe(3+) pair-mediated Fenton reaction can generate a large 
      number of free radicals to accelerate gelation. Owing to the abundant hydrogen 
      bonds and metal coordination bonds, the AL-Fe(3+)/PAA hydrogels possessed 
      excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 38 kPa), adhesion properties 
      (18 kPa for pigskin), and self-healing ability (78 % for tensile strength and 
      88 % for tensile modulus). In addition, hydrogel-based sensors with high 
      durability, strain sensitivity, and fast response times were employed to 
      accurately monitor motion or electrophysiological signals. Subsequently, a 
      portable sensing device for the wireless and remote monitoring of a user's motion 
      status was integrated. As a result, an AL-Fe(3+)-H(2)O(2) autocatalytic system 
      has great potential for use in hydrogel preparation in flexible bioelectronics 
      and wearable sensors. It can promote the sustainable development of flexible 
      bioelectronics.

AB  - Rhodomonas salina, Cryptophyta, Rhodomonas genus, is a valuable source for live 
      feed in aquaculture and for the production of phycoerythrin (PE). In this study, 
      PE was extracted from Rhodomonas salina and characterized as having a molecular 
      weight of approximately 24 kDa, an absorbance at 545 nm, and a purity of up to 
      6.61 (which meets reagent grade requirements with an OD545/OD280 ratio >4). The 
      effects of PE on anticancer activity and its underlying mechanisms were evaluated 
      to assess the immunomodulatory potential on the human lung cancer A549 cell line. 
      Biochemical assays and western blot analysis were applied to confirm the immune 
      mechanisms. The results showed that after 24 h of exposure to PE, the 
      proliferation of A549 cells was significantly and dose-dependently decreased. PE 
      also caused the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decrease in 
      mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The further results showed that PE can 
      remarkably enhance the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and p53. 
      Simultaneously, the BCL-2 family was also affected and had some changes, such as 
      the dramatically enhance of Bim and Bak and the decrease of Bcl-2 level. However, 
      it is interesting to note that there was no apparent alteration in Bax expression 
      during the experiment. Furthermore, the biological mechanism for the potential of 
      PE to induce apoptosis showed that the ERK/Bak and the JNK/caspase-3 signaling 
      pathway were activated. This study provides evidence that the anticancer activity 
      of PE in Rhodomonas salina may have potential for preventing cancer and serving 
      as a novel immunostimulant in the pharmaceutical industry.

AB  - The adsorption of the trimethylthiazoline (TMT) on the human olfactory receptor 
      OR5K1 and the mouse olfactory receptor Olfr175 was the object of the present 
      paper. The main contribution of this work was to characterize stereographically 
      and energetically OR5K1 and Olfr175 activated by trimethylthiazoline molecules 
      docked on the human and the mouse olfactory binding pockets using the grand 
      canonical ensemble in statistical physics. The experimental data and the advanced 
      statistical physics models revealed that the adsorption of the 
      trimethylthiazoline on the human olfactory receptor OR5K1 can be interpreted 
      using the monolayer model with single energy, while the monolayer model with two 
      energies described the interaction between the trimethylthiazoline molecules and 
      the mouse olfactory receptor Olfr175. In fact, the investigated odorant was shown 
      to be docked by a multi-docking process and non parallel orientation on OR5K1 and 
      Olfr175 since the values of the number of TMT molecules per binding site n were 
      superior to 1. The proposed models were applied to calculate the human and the 
      mouse olfactory receptor binding site size distributions relative to TMT, which 
      were spread out from 0.30 to 20 nm with a maximum at about 1.75 nm for OR5K1 and 
      from 1 to 25 nm with a peak at about 4.25 nm for Olfr175. Furthermore, it was 
      found from the calculated molar adsorption energies, which were lower than 
      11 kJ/mol, that physical adsorption process was occurred in the two olfactory 
      systems. The adsorption energy distributions relative to TMT can be also 
      calculated in order to understand of olfaction process in general through the 
      determination of olfactory bands (i. e., adsorption energy distribution bands), 
      which were situated between 0 and 10.50 kJ/mol and between 3 and 12.50 kJ/mol for 
      OR5K1 and Olfr175, respectively. Referring to the investigation of thermodynamic 
      functions governing the adsorption process such as the adsorption entropy, the 
      Gibbs free enthalpy and the internal energy, it may be noted that the disorder 
      peak of the two olfactory systems was reached when the equilibrium concentration 
      was equal to the concentration at half saturation. In addition, the Gibbs free 
      enthalpy and the internal energy were calculated and their negative values 
      indicated that the adsorption process involved in the olfactory mechanism was 
      exothermic and spontaneous nature.

AB  - In general, the relationship between the predicted functional consequences of 
      missense mutations mapping to genes known to be involved in human diseases and 
      the severity of disease manifestations is weak. In this study, we tested in pigs 
      whether missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), predicted to have 
      consequences on the function of genes related to lipid metabolism are associated 
      with lipid phenotypes. Association analysis demonstrated that nine out of 72 
      nominally associated SNPs were classified as "highly" or "very highly consistent" 
      in silico-predicted functional mutations and did not show association with lipid 
      traits expected to be affected by inactivation of the corresponding gene. 
      Although the lack of endophenotypes and the limited sample size of certain 
      genotypic classes might have limited to some extent the reach of the current 
      study, our data indicate that present-day bioinformatic tools have a modest 
      ability to predict the impact of missense mutations on complex phenotypes.

AB  - Peptides, which are important components of the human body, appear in different 
      chemistry applications. Perhaps the most important of these applications is the 
      use of these structures in drug delivery systems due to their biocompatibility 
      properties. Diphenylalanine (FF) peptide-based systems, which are part of the 
      ß-amyloid polypeptide sequence and are known as the smallest dipeptide group, are 
      particularly preferred due to their biocompatible nature, thermal stability, high 
      ionic strength in water in new targeted drug systems. Epirubicin, the epimer of 
      doxorubicin, is utilized in treating lung cancer. The side effects and the 
      applied doses of epirubicin are being tried to be reduced. Therefore, in this 
      study, epirubicin-loaded tert-butyloxycarbonyl protected diphenylalanine (Boc)-FF 
      particles were synthesized and characterized and the effects of these peptides on 
      cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis on non-small cell lung 
      cancer cells (NSCLC) (A549) were evaluated. According to the results of the 
      study, it was determined that epirubicin-loaded Boc-FF dipeptides significantly 
      reduced the viability, oxidative stress, and increased DNA damage and apoptosis 
      in the cells. The study suggests that epirubicin-loaded Boc-FF particles can be 
      used as an alternative drug carrier for NSCLC treatment due to their 
      physiological, chemical, and biological activity.

AB  - Prior studies indicated the involvement of neuroinflammation in the dopaminergic 
      neurodegeneration in mice of paraquat (PQ)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD), but 
      the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study explored 
      whether microglia-mediated inflammation disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB) and 
      its related mechanism. C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with PQ, 
      twice a week for six weeks, following with or without minocycline 
      (intraperitoneal injection, once every two days). The microglial activation, BBB 
      permeability, expression of tight junctions (TJs) proteins and matrix 
      metalloproteinase (MMP), as well as the loss of dopaminergic neurons and 
      neurological deficits assessment, were evaluated. Minocycline efficiently 
      restrained nigral microglial activation induced by PQ in mice. PQ-induced 
      increase of EB content in the brain and excessive expression of zonula occludin-1 
      (ZO-1), claudin-5 and occludin were significantly dampened by minocycline 
      treatment. Inhibition of microglial activation by minocycline greatly ameliorated 
      the loss of dopaminergic neurons and neurological dysfunctions in PQ-exposed 
      mice. Also, microglial inactivation downregulated the expression of MMP-2/9 in 
      PQ-lesioned mice. These findings suggested the potential protection of 
      suppressing microglia-mediated neuroinflammation against dopaminergic 
      neurodegeneration through attenuating BBB disruption in a mouse of PQ-induced PD, 
      and MMP-2/9 might involve in the contribution, which needs to be verified in 
      future study.

AB  - In our previous study, we found that the Spfoxl-2 transcript was highly expressed 
      in gonads and explored its potential target genes in the ovary of Scylla 
      paramamosain. In the current study, we primally analyzed its potential target 
      genes in the testis through RNAi and RNA-Seq technology and compared with that in 
      the ovary. The results showed that a total of 7892 unigenes were differentially 
      expressed after Spfoxl-2 silencing in the testis, including plenty of conserved 
      genes involved in testicular development, such as Dmrt family genes, Sox family 
      genes, Caspase family genes, Cdk family genes, Kinesin family genes, Fox family 
      genes and other genes. Further analysis revealed that these differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in crucial pathways involved in 
      spermatogenesis, such as DNA replication, Cell cycle, Spliceosome, Homologous 
      recombination, Meiosis and Apoptosis. The comparison results of potential target 
      genes in the ovary and testis reveal 135 common potential target genes, including 
      some genes involved in the immune response. According to our knowledge, the 
      present work was the first to disclose the functions of foxl-2 in the testis of 
      crustacean species using transcriptome analysis. It not only identifies key genes 
      and pathways involved in the testicular development of S. paramamosain, but also 
      reveals a new molecular-level understanding of the function of foxl-2 in 
      testicular development.

TI  - Digestive and metabolic bioavailability in healthy humans of (15)N-labeled 
      rapeseed and flaxseed protein incorporated in biscuits.
LID - S0002-9165(23)30195-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ajcnut.2023.02.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the search to diversify protein sources for humans, oilseeds are 
      good candidates due to the high protein content of their coproducts after oil 
      extraction. Among them, rapeseed presents a well-balanced amino acid (AA) 
      profile. Flaxseed is an emerging source but the nutritional value of its protein 
      is not yet documented. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the nitrogen (N) 
      and AA bioavailability of these protein sources. METHODS: Nineteen healthy 
      volunteers were intubated with a naso-ileal tube. They ingested 156 g biscuits 
      containing intrinsically labeled (15)N rapeseed (n = 10) or flaxseed (n = 9) 
      protein over a 4 h period. Ileal digesta, blood and urine were sampled over 8 h 
      after the first meal ingestion. N, (15)N enrichment and AAs were measured to 
      determine digestive and deamination losses. Ileal digestibility, the digestible 
      indispensable AA score (DIAAS) and net post prandial protein utilization (NPPU) 
      were calculated. RESULTS: Real ileal digestibility was 80.7±6.5% for rapeseed 
      protein and 92.2±2.0% for flaxseed protein (P = 0.0002). Mean indispensable AA 
      (IAA) digestibility reached 84.1±6.9% and 93.3±6.7% for rapeseed and flaxseed, 
      respectively, lysine being the lowest digestible IAA for both sources. Despite 
      moderate digestibility, the DIAAS was 1.1 for rapeseed but only 0.6 for flaxseed 
      due to lysine insufficiency. Deamination losses accounted for 20.0±6.5% of 
      dietary N for flaxseed and 11.0±2.8% for rapeseed (P = 0.002). The NPPU did not 
      differ between the protein sources, with 71.3±6.5% for flaxseed and 69.7±7.6% for 
      rapeseed. CONCLUSION: Despite good digestibility, flaxseed protein cooked in 
      biscuits was penalized by both lysine insufficiency and poor lysine digestibility 
      that decreased its DIAAS and increased deamination. By contrast, rapeseed was 
      moderately digestible but presented no limiting IAA, resulting in an excellent 
      DIAAS and low deamination. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as 
      NCT04024605.

      Subvariant with High Fitness but Without Increased Disease Severity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology and impact of Omicron BR.2.1, an 
      emergent SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2.75 sublineage displaying high fitness compared 
      to other co-circulating subvariants in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. METHODS: 
      From 1 September to 26 November 2022, 4,971 SARS-CoV-2 consensus genomes from 
      unique patients were generated, and correlated with international travel and 
      reinfection history, and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: 
      BR.2.1 became the predominant variant by late November, and was responsible for a 
      significantly higher proportion of community-acquired cases during the study 
      period (55% vs. 38%, p<0.001). Reinfections (defined as occurring between 6 and 
      24 weeks after a prior diagnosis of COVID-19) were significantly higher amongst 
      BR.2.1 compared to non-BR.2.1 infected persons (17.0 vs. 6.0%, p<0.001). BR.2.1 
      cases were also significantly younger compared to non-BR.2.1 (median age 48 years 
      (IQR 32) vs. 53 years (IQR 32), p=0.004). The proportion of patients admitted to 
      ICU with BR.2.1 was not significantly higher than other subvariants (2.3% vs. 
      2.0%, p=0.717). CONCLUSIONS: Having emerged locally within NSW, BR.2.1 caused a 
      significant number of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, but with disease severity 
      comparable to other currently circulating lineages. Given its rapid rise in 
      prevalence, BR.2.1 has the potential to become established internationally.

      to mycobacteria.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is usually administered 
      at birth to protect against severe forms of tuberculosis in children. BCG also 
      confers some protection against other infections, possibly mediated by innate 
      immune training. We investigated whether newborn BCG vaccination modulates 
      myeloid and natural killer (NK) cell responses to mycobacteria. METHODS: BCG 
      vaccination was either administered at birth or delayed to 6 or 10 weeks of age 
      in 130 South African infants. Whole blood was stimulated with BCG and CD4 T, 
      myeloid and NK cell responses measured by flow cytometry; levels of secreted 
      cytokines were measured by multiplex bead array. RESULTS: Newborn BCG vaccination 
      was associated with significantly higher frequencies of BCG-reactive, 
      cytokine-expressing CD4(+) T cells and IFNγ-expressing NK cells, compared with 
      unvaccinated infants, but no differences in cytokine-expressing CD33(+) myeloid 
      cells were observed. Induction of BCG-reactive IFNγ-expressing NK cells was not 
      associated with markers of NK cell maturation, differentiation or cytokine 
      receptor expression. BCG-reactive NK cell responses correlated directly with 
      levels of secreted IL-2 and IFNγ and the innate pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, 
      IL-1β and TNF in BCG vaccinated infants only. CONCLUSION: We showed that 
      BCG-reactive IFNγ-expressing NK cells are strongly induced by BCG vaccination in 
      infants and are likely amplified through by-stander cytokines.

AB  - Cancer is a major public health concern, and screening for cancer is a on-going 
      issue in our practice. The risk of cancer in patients with chronic inflammatory 
      rheumatic diseases varies according to their personal medical history, underlying 
      rheumatic disease and its treatment. However, to date, no rheumatology learned 
      society has established specific recommendations for cancer screening in patients 
      with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases. In this review, we provide an 
      overview of the risk of cancer in chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases 
      (related to the disease itself or its treatment), cancer screening in the general 
      population and in immunocompromised subjects, and cancer screening in patients 
      with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several studies have reported an increased incidence of cancer in 
      patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). The presence of RNA polymerase III 
      antibodies (anti-RNA Pol 3) associates with an increased risk of cancer, but 
      other risk factors need yet to be identified. We aimed to assess clinical and 
      immunological predictive factors of cancer-associated SSc to guide clinicians 
      when setting up selective cancer screening. METHODS: We conducted a monocentric, 
      retrospective, observational study of SSc patients with and without associated 
      malignancy. Clinical, laboratory and imaging data were collected, as well as SSc 
      treatment. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the type of cancer and 
      the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 464 SSc patients, 74 (16%) had cancer, with 
      breast (n=26) and lung cancer (n=13) being the most frequent. Diagnosis of cancer 
      was made less than 3 years before or after SSc diagnosis for 23 patients (31%). 
      In a multivariate analysis, anti-RNA Pol 3 and anti-SSA antibodies were 
      significantly associated with an increased overall risk of cancer with an odds 
      ratio (OR) of 4.12 (95% CI [1.6-10.7]; p<0.01) and 2.43 (95% CI [1.1-5.4]; 
      p<0.05), respectively. Age at diagnosis of SSc and delay from the SSc diagnosis 
      were also independent risk factors of cancer. Interstitial lung disease and 
      anti-topoisomerase antibodies were associated with an increased risk of lung 
      cancer and cancer occuring more than three years after SSc diagnosis. CONCLUSION: 
      In addition to anti RNA Pol 3 antibodies, anti SSA antibodies associated with an 
      increased risk of cancer in SSc patients. Interstitial lung disease was a risk 
      factor specifically for lung cancer and cancers diagnosed more than 3 years after 
      SSc diagnosis. For these patients, a systematic and regular cancer screening 
      should be considered.

AB  - Various scores have attempted to predict the onset of RA. In particular, EULAR 
      proposed a simple rule to identify new onset arthralgia suspicious for 
      progression to RA. However, its specificity would likely be higher if serological 
      tests were included. In patients with clinical arthritis, reliable predictive 
      criteria for progression to RA have also been identified. Overall, the validity 
      of the available scores is still being debated. Such scores do not fully account 
      for the interactions between risk factors in specific subpopulations. New 
      technologies could help to overcome these limitations, but we need databases 
      containing a sufficient number of RA and pre-RA patients, including 
      pre-diagnostic monitoring. Today, the existing predictive rules cannot compete 
      with expert opinions.

AB  - AIM: We investigated the ability of baicalein (BAI) to enhance the anticancer 
      potential of capecitabine (CAP) in the MCF-7 cell line and its protective effect 
      on CAP-induced cardiotoxicity in female Wistar rats. METHODS AND KEY FINDINGS: In 
      vitro study involved evaluating the effect of BAI and/or CAP on cell viability, 
      cell cycle progression, and BAX and Bcl2 gene expression in MCF-7 cells. 
      Co-treatment of BAI with CAP significantly reduced the viability of MCF-7 cells, 
      improved their cytotoxic effect, markedly elevated the percentage of the sub-G1 
      population, drastically reduced the G2/M population, and significantly altered 
      the mRNA expression of BAX and Bcl2 genes compared with each treatment alone. In 
      vivo study revealed that the oral administration of CAP (140 mg/kg BW) to adult 
      female rats significantly elevated the levels of serum creatine kinase-myocardial 
      band (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and 
      interleukin (IL)-1β and cardiac TNF-α, IL-1β malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, 
      whereas it reduced the serum and cardiac total antioxidant capacity (TAC), level 
      of cardiac glutathione (GSH) and activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) with a 
      vast array of circulatory, inflammatory, degenerative, and necrotic alterations 
      in the cardiac tissue. Furthermore, CAP administration significantly upregulated 
      the mRNA expression of NF-κB, TLR4, MyD88, ATF6, CHOP, and JNK genes. Concurrent 
      administration of BAI (200 mg/kg BW) and CAP significantly improved the 
      biochemical alterations and cardiac oxidant/antioxidant status and architecture. 
      In addition, it modulated the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and endoplasmic reticulum 
      stress. SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, BAI can augment the anticancer potential of CAP 
      and alleviate its cardiotoxic effects during cancer treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that eHealth approaches can be effective in reducing 
      HIV risk, their implementation requirements for public health scale up are not 
      well established, and effective strategies to bring these programs into practice 
      are still unknown. Keep It Up! (KIU!) is an online program proven to reduce HIV 
      risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and ideal candidate to develop 
      and evaluate novel strategies for implementing eHealth HIV prevention programs. 
      KIU! 3.0 is a Type III Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation cluster randomized 
      trial designed to 1) compare two strategies for implementing KIU!: 
      community-based organizations (CBO) versus centralized direct-to-consumer (DTC) 
      recruitment; 2) examine the effect of strategies and determinants on variability 
      in implementation success; and 3) develop materials for sustainment of KIU! after 
      the trial concludes. In this article, we describe the approaches used to achieve 
      these aims. METHODS: Using county-level population estimates of YMSM, 66 counties 
      were selected and randomized 2:1 to the CBO and DTC approaches. The RE-AIM model 
      was used to drive outcome measurements, which were collected from CBO staff, 
      YMSM, and technology providers. Mixed-methods research mapped onto the domains of 
      the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will examine determinants 
      and their relationship with implementation outcomes. DISCUSSION: In comparing our 
      implementation recruitment models, we are examining two strategies which have 
      shown effectiveness in delivering health technology interventions in the past, 
      yet little is known about their comparative advantages and disadvantages in 
      implementation. The results of the trial will further the understanding of 
      eHealth prevention intervention implementation.

AB  - Cancer immunotherapy has been shown to achieve significant antitumor effects in a 
      variety of malignancies. Out of all the immune checkpoint molecules, PD-1/PD-L1 
      inhibitor therapy has achieved great success. However, only some cancer patients 
      benefit from this treatment strategy owing to drug resistance. Therefore, 
      identifying the underlying modulators of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway to completely 
      comprehend the mechanisms of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment is crucially important. 
      Recent research has validated that m6A modification plays a critical role in the 
      PD-1/PD-L1 axis, thus regulating the immune response and immunotherapy 
      strategies. In this review, we summarized the latest research on the regulation 
      of m6A modification in PD-1/PD-L1 pathways in cancer proliferation, invasion, and 
      prognosis based on different kinds of cancers and discussed the possible 
      mechanisms. We also reviewed m6A-associated lncRNAs in the regulation of the 
      PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. More importantly, we outlined the influence of m6A modulation 
      on anti-PD-1 therapy and m6A-related molecules that could predict the curative 
      effect of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Further studies exploring the definitive 
      regulation of m6A on the PD1/PD-1 pathway and immunotherapy are needed, which may 
      address some of the current limitations in immunotherapy.

AB  - Despite some advances in targeted therapeutics of human cancers, curative cancer 
      treatment still remains a tremendous challenge due to the occurrence of drug 
      resistance. A variety of underlying resistance mechanisms to targeted cancer 
      drugs have recently revealed that the dual-target therapeutic strategy would be 
      an attractive avenue. Compared to drug combination strategies, one agent 
      simultaneously modulating two druggable targets generally shows fewer adverse 
      reactions and lower toxicity. As a consequence, the dual-target small molecule 
      has been extensively explored to overcome drug resistance in cancer therapy. 
      Thus, in this review, we focus on summarizing drug resistance mechanisms of 
      cancer cells, such as enhanced drug efflux, deregulated cell death, DNA damage 
      repair, and epigenetic alterations. Based upon the resistance mechanisms, we 
      further discuss the current therapeutic strategies of dual-target small molecules 
      to overcome drug resistance, which will shed new light on exploiting more 
      intricate mechanisms and relevant dual-target drugs for future cancer 
      therapeutics.

AB  - Given the liver's remarkable and unique regenerative capacity, researchers have 
      long focused on liver progenitor cells (LPCs) and liver cancer stem cells 
      (LCSCs). LPCs can differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. 
      However, the mechanism underlying cell conversion and its distinct contribution 
      to liver homeostasis and tumorigenesis remain unclear. In this review, we discuss 
      the complicated conversions involving LPCs and LCSCs. As the critical 
      intermediate state in malignant transformation, LPCs play double-edged sword 
      roles. LPCs are not only involved in hepatic wound-healing responses by 
      supplementing liver cells and bile duct cells in the damaged liver but may 
      transform into LCSCs under dysregulation of key signaling pathways, resulting in 
      refractory malignant liver tumors. Because LPC lineages are temporally and 
      spatially dynamic, we discuss crucial LPC subgroups and summarize regulatory 
      factors correlating with the trajectories of LPCs and LCSCs in the liver tumor 
      microenvironment. This review elaborates on the double-edged sword roles of LPCs 
      to help understand the liver's regenerative potential and tumor heterogeneity. 
      Understanding the sources and transformations of LPCs is essential in determining 
      how to exploit their regenerative capacity in the future.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer (PC) is very deadly and difficult to treat. The presence of 
      hypoxia has been shown to increase the probability of cancer developing and 
      spreading. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC/PC) has traditionally viewed a 
      highly lethal form of cancer due to its high occurrence of early metastases. 
      Desmoplasia/stroma is often thick and collagenous, with pancreatic stellate cells 
      as the primary source (PSCs). Cancer cells and other stromal cells interact with 
      PSCs, promoting disease development. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-MET 
      pathway have been proposed as a growth factor mechanism mediating this 
      interaction. Human growth factor (HGF) is secreted by pancreatic stellate cells 
      (PSCs), and its receptor, c-MET, is generated by pancreatic cancer cells and 
      endothelial cells. Hypoxia is frequent in malignant tumors, particularly 
      pancreatic (PC). Hypoxia results from limitless tumor development and promotes 
      survival, progression, and invasion. Hypoxic is becoming a critical driver and 
      therapeutic target of pancreatic cancer as its hypoxia microenvironment is 
      defined. Recent breakthroughs in cancer biology show that hypoxia promotes tumor 
      proliferation, aggressiveness, and therapeutic resistance. Hypoxia-inducible 
      factors (HIFs) stabilize hypoxia signaling. Hypoxia cMet is a key component of 
      pancreatic tumor microenvironments, which also have a fibrotic response, that 
      hypoxia, promotes and modulates. c-Met is a tyrosine-protein kinase. As describe 
      it simply, the MET gene in humans' codes for a protein called hepatocyte growth 
      factor receptor (HGFR). Most cancerous tumors and pancreatic cancer in 
      particular, suffer from a lack of oxygen (PC). Due to unrestrained tumor 
      development, hypoxia develops, actively contributing to tumor survival, 
      progression, and invasion. As the processes by which hypoxia signaling promotes 
      invasion and metastasis become clear, c-MET has emerged as an important 
      determinant of pancreatic cancer malignancy and a potential pharmacological 
      target. This manuscript provides the most current findings on the role of hypoxia 
      and HGF/c-MET expression in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Despite considerable advances in the evolution of anticancer therapies, 
      metastasis still remains the main cause of cancer mortality. Therefore, current 
      strategies for cancer cure should be redirected towards prevention of metastasis. 
      Targeting metastatic pathways represents a promising therapeutic opportunity 
      aimed at obstructing tumor cell dissemination and metastatic colonization. In 
      this review, we focus on preclinical studies and clinical trials over the last 
      five years that showed high efficacy in suppressing metastasis through targeting 
      lymph node dissemination, tumor cell extravasation, reactive oxygen species, 
      pre-metastatic niche, exosome machinery, and dormancy.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is a lethal condition with a rising incidence and often 
      presents at an advanced stage, contributing to abysmal five-year survival rates. 
      Unspecific symptoms and the current lack of biomarkers and screening tools hamper 
      early diagnosis. New technologies for liquid biopsies and their respective 
      evaluation in pancreatic cancer patients have emerged over recent years. The term 
      liquid biopsy summarizes the sampling and analysis of circulating tumor cells 
      (CTCs), small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), and tumor DNA (ctDNA) from body 
      fluids. The major advantages of liquid biopsies rely on their minimal 
      invasiveness and repeatability, allowing serial sampling for dynamic insights to 
      aid diagnosis, particularly early detection, risk stratification, and precision 
      medicine in pancreatic cancer. However, liquid biopsies have not yet developed 
      into a new pillar for clinicians' routine armamentarium. Here, we summarize 
      recent findings on the use of liquid biopsy in pancreatic cancer patients. We 
      discuss current challenges and future perspectives of this potentially powerful 
      alternative to conventional tissue biopsies.

AB  - Endothelial dysfunction is critical in the pulmonary vasculature during pulmonary 
      hypertension (PH). Moreover, in PH, increased inflammation and 
      oxidative/nitrosative stress cause DNA damage, activating poly (ADP-ribose) 
      polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Meloche et al. (2014) and our previous research have shown 
      that inhibiting PARP-1 is protective in PH and associated RV hypertrophy. 
      However, the role of PARP-1 in pulmonary arterial endothelial dysfunction has not 
      been explored completely. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the 
      involvement of PARP-1 in endothelial dysfunction associated with PH. Hypoxia (1% 
      O2) was used to induce a PH-like phenotype in human pulmonary artery endothelial 
      cells (HPAECs), and PARP-1 inhibition was achieved via siRNA (60 nM). For the in 
      vivo study, male Sprague Dawley rats were administered monocrotaline (MCT; 60 
      mg/kg, SC, once) to induce PH, and 1, 5-isoquinolinediol (ISO; 3 mg/kg) was 
      administered daily intraperitoneally to inhibit PARP-1. PARP-1 inhibition 
      decreased proliferation and inflammation, as well as improved mitochondrial 
      dysfunction in hypoxic HPAECs. Furthermore, PARP-1 inhibition also promoted 
      apoptosis by increasing DNA damage in hypoxic HPAECs. In addition, inhibition of 
      PARP-1 reduced cell migration, VEGF expression, and tubule formation in hypoxic 
      HPAECs. In in vivo studies, PARP-1 inhibition by ISO significantly decreased the 
      RVP and RVH as well as improved endothelial function by increasing the pulmonary 
      vascular reactivity and expression of p-eNOS in MCT-treated rats.

TI  - Blood immune cells from people with HIV on antiviral regimens that contain 
      tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) have 
      differential metabolic signatures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitochondria regulate immune and organ function. It is unknown 
      whether higher intracellular drug levels observed in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs) treated with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) compared to tenofovir 
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF) may alter mitochondrial function and energy production 
      in immune cells in HIV((+)) patients. METHODS: Cellular bioenergetics were 
      determined in PBMCs from HIV-1((-)) participants exposed to TAF versus TDF in 
      vitro, at a comparable concentration to a clinically relevant plasma exposure. A 
      decrease in cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) at baseline (basal-OCR) and 
      under cellular stress (max-OCR) may suggest mitochondrial dysfunction. We also 
      assessed the in vivo impact of TAF vs TDF on OCR in PBMCs from 26 people with HIV 
      (PWH) interchanged from TDF-based to TAF-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) over 
      a 9-month period in the setting of an open label clinical trial. The Wilcoxon and 
      Mann Whitney tests were used for comparison of continuous variables. RESULTS: 
      PBMCs from HIV-1((-)) participants exposed in vitro to a concentration of 
      0.12-3.3 μM for TAF and TDF at 2 and 24 h, reduced basal and maximal OCR compared 
      to vehicle control. Switch studies of antivirals (TAF vs TDF) within the same PWH 
      showed that TAF-based ART was associated with reduced OCR compared to TDF-based 
      ART in PBMCs. We observed that TAF-treated PBMCs selectively relied more on 
      glucose/pyruvate supply rather than fatty acid to fuel their mitochondria. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared to TDF, TAF may alter bioenergetics in immune cells from 
      PWH in vitro and in vivo. The clinical significance in terms of the differential 
      impact caused by TAF versus TDF on mitochondrial function and energy production 
      in immune cells, a regulator of immune function, requires further studied in HIV, 
      preexposure prophylaxis and hepatitis B.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic disorder affecting the functioning of the brain. 
      It can lead to irrational behaviour amongst the patients suffering from this 
      disease. A low-cost diagnostic needs to be developed for SZ so that timely 
      treatment can be provided to the patients. In this work, we propose an accurate 
      and easy-to-implement system to detect SZ using electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      signals. The signal is divided into sub-band components by a Fourier-based 
      technique that can be implemented in real-time using fast Fourier transform. 
      Thereafter, statistical features are computed from these components. Further, 
      look ahead pattern (LAP) is developed as a feature to capture local variations in 
      the EEG signal. The fusion of these two distinct schemes enables a thorough 
      examination of EEG signals. Kruskal-Wallis test is utilized for the selection of 
      significant features. Various machine learning classifiers are employed and the 
      proposed framework achieves 98.62% and 99.24% accuracy in identifying SZ cases, 
      considering two distinct datasets, using boosted trees classifier. This method 
      provides a promising candidate for widespread deployment in efficient real-time 
      systems for SZ detection.

AB  - No-touch bipolar radiofrequency ablation (bRFA) is known to produce incomplete 
      tumour ablation with a 'butterfly-shaped' coagulation zone when the 
      interelectrode distance exceeds a certain threshold. Although non-confluent 
      coagulation zone can be avoided by not implementing the no-touch mode, doing so 
      exposes the patient to the risk of tumour track seeding. The present study 
      investigates if prior infusion of saline into the tissue can overcome the issues 
      of non-confluent or butterfly-shaped coagulation. A computational modelling 
      approach based on the finite element method was carried out. A two-compartment 
      model comprising the tumour that is surrounded by healthy liver tissue was 
      developed. Three cases were considered; i) saline infusion into the tumour 
      centre; ii) one-sided saline infusion outside the tumour; and iii) two-sided 
      saline infusion outside the tumour. For each case, three different saline volumes 
      were considered, i.e. 6, 14 and 22 ml. Saline concentration was set to 15% w/v. 
      Numerical results showed that saline infusion into the tumour centre can overcome 
      the butterfly-shaped coagulation only if the infusion volume is sufficient. On 
      the other hand, one-sided infusion outside the tumour did not overcome this. 
      Two-sided infusion outside the tumour produced confluent coagulation zone with 
      the largest volume. Results obtained from the present study suggest that saline 
      infusion, when carried out correctly, can be used to effectively eradicate liver 
      cancer. This presents a practical solution to address non-confluent coagulation 
      zone typical of that during two-probe bRFA treatment.

AB  - Powered ankle-foot orthoses can be utilised to overcome gait abnormalities such 
      as foot drop; however, normal gait is rarely restored with compensatory gait 
      patterns arising and prevalence of gait asymmetry. Therefore, this study aims to 
      determine the effect of orthosis mass and mass distribution on the swing phase of 
      gait, to understand residual gait asymmetry with orthosis use. Using a triple 
      compound pendulum model, which accounts for mass distribution of the limb and 
      orthosis, the swing phase of gait is simulated in terms of natural dynamics and 
      the effect of an orthosis on kinematic parameters is quantitatively determined. 
      It was found that additional mass causes faster and shorter steps on the affected 
      side due to rapid knee extension and reduced hip flexion, with particular 
      actuator positions and natural cadence causing varying severity of these effects. 
      Our study suggests that this model could be used as a preliminary design tool to 
      identify subject specific optimum orthosis mass distribution of a powered 
      ankle-foot orthosis, without the need for motion data or experimental trials. 
      This optimisation intends to more accurately mimic natural swing phase 
      kinematics, consequently allowing for the reduction in severity of gait asymmetry 
      and the potential to improve rehabilitative outcomes.

TI  - Comparison of the biomechanical effects of lumbar disc degeneration on normal 
      patients and osteoporotic patients: A finite element analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some older patients who suffered from both conditions (disc 
      degeneration and osteoporosis) have higher surgical risks and longer 
      postoperative recovery times. Understanding the relation between disc 
      degeneration and osteoporosis is fundamental to know the mechanisms of orthopedic 
      disorders and improve clinical treatment. However, there is a lack of finite 
      element (FE) studies to predict the combined effects of disc degeneration and 
      osteoporosis. So the aim of the present study is to explore the differences of 
      biomechanical effects of lumbar disc degeneration on normal patients and 
      osteoporotic patients. METHODS: A normal lumbar spine finite element model (FEM) 
      was developed based on the geometric information of a healthy male subject (age 
      35 years; height 178 cm; weight 65 kg). This normal lumbar spine FEM was modified 
      to build three lumbar spine degeneration models simulating mild, moderate and 
      severe grades of disc degeneration at the L4-L5 segment. Then the degenerative 
      lumbar spine models for osteoporotic patients were constructed on the basis of 
      the above-mentioned degeneration models. Firstly, the normal model (flexion: 8 
      Nm; extension: 6 Nm; lateral bending: 6 Nm; torsion: 4 Nm) and degenerative 
      models (10 Nm) were calibrated under pure moment load, respectively. Secondly, 
      under a 400 N follower load, the 7.5 Nm moments of different directions were 
      applied on all models to simulate different motion postures. Finally, under the 
      above loading conditions, we calculated and analyzed the range of motion (ROM), 
      Mises stress in cortical (MSC1), Mises stress in endplate (MSE), Mises stress in 
      cancellous (MSC2), and Mises stress in post (MSP). RESULTS: Compared with disc 
      degeneration patients without osteoporosis, the ROM, MSC1, and MSE of 
      osteoporosis patients with various disc degeneration decreased in all postures, 
      while the MSC2 and MSP increased. With increase in the degree of disc 
      degeneration, the reduction proportions of ROM and MSE in osteoporotic patients 
      gradually increased, while the reduction percentages in MSC1 of osteoporotic 
      patients gradually decreased. The increase percentages of MSC2 in osteoporotic 
      patients gradually increased. Given the progressive changes of disc degeneration, 
      the changes in MSP in osteoporosis patients were uneven. CONCLUSION: In summary, 
      the effect of disc degeneration on flexibility in the two kinds of patients 
      (osteoporosis and non-osteoporosis patients) was nearly same. By comparing the 
      remaining biomechanical parameters (MSC1, MSE, MSC2, and MSP), we found that 
      degenerated intervertebral discs caused changes in loading patterns of 
      osteoporosis patients. Disc degeneration reduced the Mises stress in the cortical 
      and endplate, which increased the Mises stress in the cancellous and post. That 
      is to say, in order to cope with the changes in bone stresses caused by disc 
      degeneration and osteoporosis, clinicians should be more careful in choosing the 
      surgical option for osteoporotic patients with disc degeneration.

AB  - Healthy sleep signifies a good physical and mental state of the body. However, 
      factors such as inappropriate work schedules, medical complications, and others 
      can make it difficult to get enough sleep, leading to various sleep disorders. 
      The identification of these disorders requires sleep stage classification. Visual 
      evaluation of sleep stages is time intensive, placing a significant strain on 
      sleep experts and prone to human errors. As a result, it is crucial to develop 
      machine learning algorithms to score sleep stages to acquire an accurate 
      diagnosis. Hence, a new methodology for automated sleep stage classification is 
      suggested using machine learning and filtering electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      signals. The national sleep research resource's (NSRR) study of osteoporotic 
      fractures (SOF) dataset comprising 453 subjects' polysomnograph (PSG) data is 
      used in this study. Only two unipolar EEG derivations C4-A1 and C3-A2 are 
      employed individually and jointly in this work. The EEG signals are decomposed 
      into sub-bands using a frequency-localized finite orthogonal quadrature Fejer 
      Korovkin wavelet filter bank. The wavelet-based entropy features are extracted 
      from sub-bands. Subsequently, extracted features are classified using machine 
      learning techniques. Our developed model obtained the highest classification 
      accuracy of 81.3%, using an ensembled bagged trees classifier with a 10-fold 
      cross-validation method and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.72. The proposed model 
      is accurate, dependable, and easy to implement and can be employed as an 
      alternative to a PSG-based system at home with minimal resources. It is also 
      ready to be tested on other EEG data to evaluate the sleep stages of healthy and 
      unhealthy subjects.

AB  - Hip dysplasia is a common orthopaedic condition in dogs and stress radiography is 
      the best diagnostic tool for early diagnosis. Objective force guidelines are 
      lacking, leaving room for errors and fraud during screening. Our objective was to 
      develop an accurate and validated measuring device that allows quantification of 
      the applied force in vivo in real-time during stress radiographic imaging. A 
      two-step approach was followed. First, four load cells were incorporated in the 
      original Vezzoni Modified Badertscher Distension Device (VMBDD) and a dedicated 
      computer program was developed. In vitro evaluations of the accuracy demonstrated 
      a trueness of 0.19 N (0.1%FS) and precision of 0.26 N (0.2%FS) for the individual 
      loadcells. The trueness and precision of the assembled VMBDmD were 0.02 N 
      (0.02%FS) and 0.52 N (0.38%FS). Secondly, the modified device was tested on 
      several cadavers. The device was similar in use as the VMBDD, did not interfere 
      with radiographic acquisition, gave the operator real-time feedback, and linked 
      the force with the radiograph. Altogether, we describe the accuracy of the VMBDmD 
      and have evaluated its use in cadavers. We saw that the device successfully 
      quantified and stored the applied force in real-time during stress radiography.

AB  - Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) is the most popular and effective 
      procedure for patients with intervertebral disc degeneration, where the 
      degenerated disc is replaced with an interbody implant (widely known as cage). 
      The design of the cage plays a vital role since it has to provide stability for 
      the anterior cervical column without any side-effects. We designed a novel S-type 
      dynamic cage for C4-C5 level, using Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) material 
      considering four different shapes namely: square, circle, rectangle and 
      elliptical, for the central window to occupy bone graft. The major design 
      constrain for a successful cage is minimized cage stress, in order to avoid 
      subsidence. Finite Element (FE) analysis results revealed that the cage stress 
      values obtained during the physiological motion varied depending upon the shape 
      of the central window provided for bone graft. The objective of this study is to 
      optimize the central window shape using the Teaching Learning Based Optimization 
      (TLBO) algorithm. It was found that square and elliptical shape bone graft cavity 
      resulted in better outcomes. Additional experimental study was also conducted 
      with a six-axis spine simulator. Based on the optimization results, we 
      manufactured two PEEK cage models with square and elliptical shaped central 
      window using additive manufacturing. A prototype model of the C4-C5 level made of 
      Polyvinylchloride (PVC) was used for experiment due to the existing constraints 
      for using a cadaveric model. The experimental results were cross-verified using 
      FE analysis. Thus, we would like to conclude that square and elliptical shape of 
      the central window were the better design factor for our novel dynamic cage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To contribute our results to increase the scientific evidence about 
      the use of radioembolization in the management of patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective review included 53 patients 
      with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with radioembolization at our center. 
      Patients were classified according to the BCLC algorithm in detail according to 
      their Child-Pugh functional status. We analyzed survival using the Kaplan-Meier 
      method. We used Cox regression analysis to determine clinically significant 
      parameters, including the doses administered in the parameters studied. RESULTS: 
      Patients ranged in age from 28 to 86 years (mean, 60 years). A total of 61 
      procedures were done. The mean activity administered was 2.8GBq (0.7-6.4GBq), 
      with a mean dose of 229.9Gy (74-425.9Gy) administered in the tumor. 
      Progression-free survival was 6.7 months and overall survival was 12.8 months. 
      Differences in disease-free survival according to BCLC and Child-Pugh 
      classification were not significant (p=0.848 and p=0.252, respectively). The 
      clinical parameters that were significantly different with respect to overall 
      survival were bilirubin levels (p<0.001), pretreatment transaminase levels (AST) 
      (p=0.022), Child-Pugh subclassification (p=0.003), and dose administered in the 
      tumor (p=0.001). Only one patient had a severe adverse reaction, developing 
      posttreatment liver failure resulting in death. CONCLUSIONS: Radioembolization is 
      safe and efficacious in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
      Liver function and the doses received by the tumor are key parameters for the 
      efficacy of treatment. The increase in the scientific evidence supports the 
      inclusion of this technique in treatment guidelines.

TI  - An attempt to reduce unnecessary surgical procedures... Can ultrasound 
      characteristics help in differentiating adenoma vs carcinoma in follicular 
      thyroid neoplasms?

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Thyroid nodules frequently require ultrasound and 
      Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) evaluation. However, FNA cytology does not 
      allow differentiation between follicular adenoma and carcinoma on Bethesda type 
      IV lesions. This situation leads to many unnecessary surgical procedures because 
      it is not possible to assure the benignity of the lesions, even when most of the 
      specimens correspond to adenomas or even other benign lesions. The objective is 
      this study is to establish if there are any US characteristics that would help us 
      to predict the risk of malignancy of nodules with a pathological diagnosis of 
      follicular neoplasm in order to achieve a more conservative management for 
      non-suspicious nodules. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 61 nodules in 61 
      patients (51 women and 10 men) that underwent thyroid surgery and had 
      histopathological results of either follicular adenoma or carcinoma. Different US 
      characteristics of the nodules were analysed (composition, echogenicity, margin, 
      calcification status, the presence of halo and overall observer suspicion of 
      malignancy) and were correlated with the histopathological analysis. RESULTS: We 
      have found a statistically significant association between the presence of 
      calcifications, ill-defined borders and overall observer suspicion or impression 
      (defined by well-known suspicious for malignancy ultrasonographic features, such 
      as calcification, poorly defined margin, and a markedly hypoechoic solid nodule; 
      and benign ultrasonographic features, such as predominantly cystic echogenic 
      composition and the presence of a perinodular hypoechogenic halo) with follicular 
      carcinoma. However all those features have shown low sensitivities in the present 
      study (30%, 30% and 50%, respectively). On the other hand, the absence of halo 
      sign has shown a sensitivity of 100% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 
      100% in our study. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of calcifications, ill-defined 
      borders and the overall impression or suspicion of malignancy associate with a 
      higher risk for follicular carcinoma in Bethesda type IV thyroid nodules but 
      their absence do not allow to predict benignity in these nodules. Inversely, when 
      a halo sign lesion is observed, benign follicular neoplasm should be considered.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of 
      transabdominal pelvic ultrasonography and bone age in identifying the onset of 
      puberty in girls at the Clínica Las Américas in Medellín, Colombia. METHODS: We 
      included girls aged ≤11 years referred to our clinic between March 2016 and March 
      2019 for signs of puberty. We compared the findings on pelvic and breast 
      ultrasonography and bone age versus the baseline measurement of luteinizing 
      hormone (LH) in serum, used as the reference standard for identifying the onset 
      of puberty. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value 
      (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive and negative likelihood 
      ratios, analyzing subgroups of patients of different ages. RESULTS: We analyzed 
      43 patients. Ultrasound assessment of breast development had the highest 
      sensitivity (94.1%) of all the imaging parameters evaluated, but its specificity 
      was low. However, characteristics such as the length of the body of the uterus 
      >3.0 cm and the presence of endometrial echoes were highly specific for 
      identifying the onset of puberty, particularly in patients aged ≤8 years. 
      CONCLUSION: Pelvic ultrasonography, ultrasonographic assessment of Tanner stage 
      of breast development, and the evaluation of bone age are useful tools for the 
      imaging confirmation of the onset of puberty. The results of this study support 
      the use of these techniques in clinical practice in the workup for pubertal 
      disorders in girls.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The current management of acute diverticulitis of the left 
      colon (ADLC) requires tests with high prognostic value. This paper analyzes the 
      usefulness of ultrasonography (US) in the initial diagnosis of ADLC and the 
      validity of current classifications schemes for ADLC. PATIENTS: This 
      retrospective observational study included patients with ADLC scheduled to 
      undergo US or computed tomography (CT) following a clinical algorithm. According 
      to the imaging findings, ADLC was classified as mild, locally complicated, or 
      complicated. We analyzed the efficacy of US in the initial diagnosis and the 
      reasons why CT was used as the first-line technique. We compared the findings 
      with published classifications schemes for ADLC. RESULTS: A total of 311 patients 
      were diagnosed with acute diverticulitis; 183 had ADLC, classified at imaging as 
      mild in 104, locally complicated in 60, and complicated in 19. The diagnosis was 
      reached by US alone in 98 patients, by CT alone in 77, and by combined US and CT 
      in 8. The main reasons for using CT as the first-line technique were the 
      radiologist's lack of experience in abdominal US and the unavailability of a 
      radiologists on call. Six patients diagnosed by US were reexamined by CT, but the 
      classification changed in only three. None of the published classification 
      schemes included all the imaging findings. CONCLUSIONS: US should be the 
      first-line imaging technique in patients with suspected ADLC. Various laboratory 
      and imaging findings are useful in establishing the prognosis of ADLC. New 
      schemes to classify the severity of ADLC are necessary to ensure optimal clinical 
      decision making.

AB  - Palpable tumors in children are a common reason for consulting a radiologist. The 
      origin of these lesions varies widely, and although they are common, classic 
      radiology books do not cover some of them. This series of two articles aims to 
      review the clinical and radiological characteristics of a selection of palpable 
      tumors in children that radiologists need to be familiar with.

AB  - The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is a format of examination 
      that enables students to be evaluated in a uniform, standardized, reliable, and 
      objective way. It is carried out in different clinical stations that simulate 
      real clinical situations and scenarios. Numerous universities in Spain and other 
      countries employ this approach for the final examination for medical school 
      students. This update describes the organization, design, and fundamentals for 
      the OSCE, proposing that radiology should form part of multidisciplinary OSCEs to 
      the extent that it forms part of clinical practice. Moreover, it is interesting 
      and opportune to introduce the OSCE in undergraduate and postgraduate training in 
      radiology. Online platforms enable bidimensional OSCEs that are cost-effective in 
      terms of staff, resources, and physical space, although this approach has certain 
      limitations. Virtual world technologies make it possible to reproduce OSCE 
      stations in three-dimensional scenarios; recent experiences in radiology have 
      shown that this approach interests and motivates students and is widely accepted 
      by them.

AB  - Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world. The most common 
      histologic subtype is adenocarcinoma. Gastric adenocarcinomas are staged using 
      the American Joint Committee on Cancer's 8th TNM classification. The perigastric 
      ligaments, mesentery, omentum, and potential spaces between the parietal and 
      visceral peritoneal linings play are important structures for staging. The spread 
      of disease is influenced by the location of the tumor within the stomach, as well 
      as by the anatomy related to the ligaments and lymph vessels. CT is the imaging 
      modality of choice for the preoperative clinical staging of gastric cancer, and 
      it is essential for planning treatment. To be able to do an adequate imaging 
      workup, radiologists need to know the different pathways through which gastric 
      cancer can spread: lymphatic, subperitoneal, direct invasion, transperitoneal, 
      hematogenous, and extramural venous invasion.

AB  - Groove pancreatitis is an uncommon type of chronic pancreatitis that affects the 
      space between the head of the pancreas, the second portion of the duodenum, and 
      the common bile duct. The main trigger is chronic alcohol abuse, which eventually 
      leads to leakage of pancreatic juices into the pancreaticoduodenal groove, 
      causing inflammation and fibrosis. The main differential diagnosis is with 
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is more common than groove pancreatitis. 
      Different imaging techniques make it possible to identify various findings (e.g., 
      duodenal thickening or duodenal and paraduodenal cysts, which are characteristic 
      of groove pancreatitis) that sometimes enable differentiation between groove 
      pancreatitis and other entities, although there are no specific findings for each 
      of them. Sometimes biopsy or surgery is required to establish the definitive 
      diagnosis. The treatment of groove pancreatitis is usually conservative, but in 
      cases in which the symptoms do not improve, interventional procedures (biliary 
      drainage) or surgery (Whipple technique) can be done.

TI  - Diaphragmatic hernia after radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases: a case 
      report and review of the literature.

AB  - A diaphragmatic hernia is the protrusion of abdominal tissues into the thoracic 
      cavity secondary to a defect in the diaphragm. Reviewing the literature, we found 
      only 44 references to diaphragmatic hernia secondary to percutaneous 
      radiofrequency treatment. The vast majority of these cases were secondary to the 
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in segments V and VIII. Nevertheless, to 
      date, this is the first reported case of diaphragmatic hernia after 
      radiofrequency ablation of a liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. 
      Complications secondary to diaphragmatic hernias are very diverse. The principal 
      risk factor for complications is the contents of the hernia; when small bowel or 
      colon segments protrude in the thoracic cavity, they can become incarcerated. 
      Asymptomatic cases have also been reported in which the diaphragmatic hernia was 
      discovered during follow-up. The pathophysiological mechanism is not totally 
      clear, but it is thought that these diaphragmatic hernias might be caused by 
      locoregional thermal damage. Given that most communications correspond to 
      asymptomatic and/or treated cases, it is likely that the incidence is 
      underestimated. However, due to the advent of percutaneous treatments, this 
      complication might be reported more often in the future. Most cases are treated 
      with primary herniorrhaphy, done with a laparoscopic or open approach at the 
      surgeon's discretion; no evidence supports the use of one approach over the 
      other. Nevertheless, it seems clear that surgery is the only definitive 
      treatment, as well as the treatment of choice if complications develop. However, 
      in asymptomatic patients in whom a diaphragmatic hernia is discovered in 
      follow-up imaging studies, management should probably be guided by the patient's 
      overall condition, taking into account the potential risks of complications 
      (contents, diameter of the opening into the thoracic cavity …).

AB  - Many patients are born with lymphatic abnormalities or are susceptible to 
      pathology following cardiac surgery. It therefore becomes important to evaluate 
      and treat lymphatic disorders in centers performing congenital heart surgery. 
      Programs can make strides towards starting a lymphatic branch if appropriately 
      equipped with proper staff, tools, and other capabilities to perform lymphatic 
      system access, imaging, and intervention. In reality, many of these components 
      already exist in most centers, and a successful and comprehensive program can be 
      established by enlisting these already established services.

AB  - Williams syndrome, and various elastin protein mediated arteriopathies, presents 
      a clinical challenge to pediatric cardiovascular specialists. In the severest 
      phenotypes, multilevel obstruction to the systemic and pulmonic arterial systems 
      result in biventricular dysfunction which can be imminently life-threatening. As 
      a longstanding, quaternary referral center for complex pulmonary arteriopathies 
      and pediatric connective tissue disease, Stanford Medicine Children's Health has 
      developed a sizeable experience managing these patients. This manuscript is a 
      summary of our current strategies, with a focus on our surgical techniques, 
      peri-procedural considerations on timing and staging of various interventions, 
      and long-term results.

AB  - Some patients with functionally univentricular circulation develop cardiac 
      failure refractory to maximal management and are supported with a ventricular 
      assist device (VAD). The purpose of this manuscript is to summarize our previous 
      publications related to single ventricle-ventricular assist device (sVAD) support 
      in patients with functionally univentricular circulation and to describe our 
      current institutional approach at University of Florida to sVAD support in 
      neonates, infants, and children prior to Fontan. Our programmatic philosophy at 
      University of Florida is to strive to identify the minority of neonates with 
      functionally univentricular circulation who are extremely high-risk prior to 
      initiating staged palliation and to stabilize these neonates with primary 
      preemptive sVAD in preparation for cardiac transplantation; our rationale for 
      this approach is related to the challenges associated with failed staged 
      palliation and subsequent bail-out sVAD support and transplantation. A subset of 
      extremely high-risk neonates and infants with functionally univentricular 
      ductal-dependent circulation undergo primary preemptive sVAD insertion and 
      subsequent cardiac transplantation. Support with VAD clearly facilitates survival 
      on the waiting list during prolonged wait times and optimizes outcomes after 
      Norwood (Stage 1) by providing an alternative pathway for extremely high-risk 
      patients. Therefore, the selective utilization of sVAD in extremely high-risk 
      neonates facilitates improved outcomes for all patients with functionally 
      univentricular ductal-dependent circulation. At University of Florida, our 
      programmatic approach to utilizing sVAD support as a bridge to transplantation in 
      the minority of neonates with functionally univentricular circulation who are 
      extremely high-risk for staged palliation is associated with Operative Mortality 
      after Norwood (Stage 1) Operation of 2.9% (2/68) and a one-year survival of 91.1% 
      (82/90) for all neonates presenting with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) 
      or HLHS-related malformation with functionally univentricular ductal-dependent 
      systemic circulation. Meanwhile, at University of Florida, for all 82 consecutive 
      neonates, infants, and children supported with pulsatile paracorporeal VAD: 
      Kaplan-Meier survival estimated one year after VAD insertion = 73.3% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI] = 64.1-83.8%), and Kaplan-Meier survival estimated five 
      years after VAD insertion = 68.3% (95% CI = 58.4-79.8%). For all 48 consecutive 
      neonates, infants, and children at University of Florida with biventricular 
      circulation supported with pulsatile paracorporeal VAD: Kaplan-Meier survival 
      estimated one year after VAD insertion = 82.7% (95% CI = 72.4-94.4%), and 
      Kaplan-Meier survival estimated five years after VAD insertion = 79.7% (95% CI = 
      68.6-92.6%). For all 34 consecutive neonates, infants, and children at University 
      of Florida with functionally univentricular circulation supported with pulsatile 
      paracorporeal sVAD: Kaplan-Meier survival estimated one year after VAD insertion 
      = 59.7% (95% CI = 44.9-79.5%), and Kaplan-Meier survival estimated five years 
      after VAD insertion = 50.5% (95% CI = 35.0-73.0%). These Kaplan-Meier survival 
      estimates for patients supported with pulsatile paracorporeal VAD are better in 
      patients with biventricular circulation in comparison to patients with 
      functionally univentricular circulation both one year after VAD insertion 
      (P=0.026) and five years after VAD insertion (P=0.010). Although outcomes after 
      VAD support in functionally univentricular patients are worse than in patients 
      with biventricular circulation, sVAD provides a reasonable chance for survival. 
      Ongoing research is necessary to improve the outcomes of these challenging 
      patients, with the goal of developing strategies where outcomes after sVAD 
      support in functionally univentricular patients are equivalent to the outcomes 
      achieved after VAD support in patients with biventricular circulation.

AB  - Medical and surgical advances have allowed single-stage total repair in neonates 
      born with complex congenital heart anomalies and aortic arch obstruction. 
      Nonetheless, total repair might be too complex or high risk in certain neonates 
      with demographic, clinical or morphologic risk factors. Alternative management 
      strategies might offer these neonates better outcomes with superior anatomic 
      repair, shorter hospitalization, reduced morbidity, and improved survival. 
      Alternative initial surgical strategies might include aortic arch repair and 
      pulmonary artery band with or without cardiopulmonary bypass, extracardiac repair 
      only and pulmonary artery band, Norwood operation, and hybrid first-stage 
      palliation; all deferring complex biventricular intra-cardiac repair to later 
      stage. The strategy choice should be personalized to each patient, taking into 
      consideration the morphologic and clinical state, and the existent goals of care.

AB  - The Ross procedure is an excellent operation to treat children and adults with 
      aortic valve disease. Compared to prosthetic aortic valve replacement, it 
      provides important clinical benefits in terms of survival, hemodynamics, freedom 
      from valve-related complications, and durability, especially in women of 
      childbearing age. However, the Ross procedure is a longer and technically more 
      challenging operation. As a result, the choice of procedure should be driven by 
      patient anatomy and clinical characteristics. This highlights the importance of 
      concentrating care in Ross reference centers where surgical expertise and 
      experience are present to ensure patient safety and long-term effectiveness of 
      the operation. This manuscript reviews the major and relative contraindications 
      to the Ross procedure.

AB  - Patients with truncus arteriosus and transposition of great arteries are prone to 
      neo-aortic valve insufficiency. Although presenting at opposite ends of the age 
      spectrum, both conditions tend to be commonly associated with neo aortic root 
      dilatation. In patients with truncus arteriosus there is an additional complexity 
      of quadricuspid valve morphology, which make up the majority of valves requiring 
      repair. A unified approach to all these patients would include reduction and 
      stabilization of the annulus and sinotubular junction, as well as achieving equal 
      and symmetrical coaptation of the valve leaflets. By systematically employing 
      these techniques, valve replacement should be avoidable in most children.

AB  - Patients with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) require 
      imaging to clarify the multiple potential anatomic sites of obstruction (fixed or 
      dynamic). Once repaired, the pathway of blood to the myocardium must not 
      encounter: (1) intrinsic ostial stenosis, (2) obstruction from compression or 
      distortion near the commissure or the intercoronary pillar, (3) stenosis where 
      the artery exits the aortic wall (due to an acutely angled "take-off"), (4) 
      compression due to a pathway between the great vessels, (5) stenosis or 
      compression along an intramural course, or (6) compression due to an 
      intramuscular (intraseptal/intraconal) course. Detailed anatomic evaluation of 
      each of these locations allows the surgeon to select an appropriate repair 
      strategy, and each of these abnormal anatomic features should be "matched" with a 
      particular surgical correction. We speculate that the most common surgical 
      repair, unroofing with or without tacking, is often inadequate, as in isolation, 
      it may not allow for correction with a large orifice from the appropriate sinus, 
      without an interarterial course. While the evidence base is insufficient to call 
      these recommendations formal guidelines, these recommendations should serve as a

AB  - Mitral valve replacement (MVR) in the very young is an imposing clinical 
      challenge. Early and late mortality risk is substantial, severe adverse events 
      are common, and redo mitral valve replacement is inevitable. Therapeutic options 
      are limited. In the older infant with an annulus of 17mm or larger, mechanical 
      MVR is associated with low risk of mortality and predictable durability. For the 
      very young with annular hypoplasia, bovine jugular vein conduit MVR appears to 
      offer equivalent or better early outcomes with the possibility of subsequent 
      valve expansion, potentially prolonging the interval to redo MVR. Experience with 
      cylinder MVR and other forms of surgeon-manufactured MVR is quite limited, and 
      there is currently no information on late outcomes or durability.

AB  - Aortic dilation is common in patients with congenital heart disease including 
      those with a bicuspid aortic valve, connective tissue disease, coarctation of the 
      aorta, and conotruncal defects. In addition, neo-aortic dilation has been 
      described in patients after aortic reconstruction including the Norwood 
      procedure, the arterial switch operation, and the Ross procedure. Although aortic 
      catastrophe is rare in patients with congenital heart disease, common pathologic 
      endpoints in these patients likely manifest with similar aortic tissue behavior. 
      A lifelong care model with similar indications for surveillance and prophylactic 
      repair to other more common aortopathies is therefore warranted. Still, 
      reoperative aortic arch reconstruction in these patients is often a complex and 
      high-risk endeavor, and in all cases, a tailored and adaptable plan ensuring 
      adequate myocardial and cerebral protection with appropriate rescue measures is 
      paramount. A surgical team taking on these challenging cases should possess an 
      armamentarium of open, hybrid, and endovascular techniques which can be 
      individualized to a patient's unique anatomy, surgical history, and concomitant 
      lesions as well as the team's measured outcomes and experience.

AB  - The field of adult congenital heart disease has changed greatly over the past 
      sixty years. As patients are now surviving longer into adulthood due to various 
      improvements in surgical technique and medical technology, the demographic of 
      patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) has changed, such that there are now 
      more adults with CHD than there are children with CHD. This older and more 
      medically complex population needs more interventions to treat residual defects 
      or sequelae of their initial surgeries, and many of these patients are now deemed 
      high risk for surgery. When the surgical risk becomes too great, either due to 
      patient complexity, surgical complexity, or both, then transcatheter procedures 
      may have a role in either mitigating or avoiding the risk altogether.

AB  - Technical skill development in congenital heart surgery (CHS) is challenging due 
      to numerous factors which potentially limit the hands-on operative exposure in 
      surgical training. These challenges have stimulated the growth of 
      simulation-based training through the development of 3D-printed models, providing 
      hands-on surgical training (HOST). From its inception in 2015, the models used in 
      the HOST program have constantly improved, and now include valvar/subvalvar 
      apparatus and better materials that mimic real tissue. Evidence shows that 
      deliberate, regular simulation practice can improve a surgeon's technical skills 
      across the spectrum of CHS. Furthermore, surgical trainees who undergo simulation 
      training are able to translate this improved performance into the operative 
      environment with improved patient outcomes. Despite evidence to support the 
      incorporation of simulation methods into congenital training, its widespread 
      adoption into training curricula remains low. This is due to numerous factors 
      including funding, lack of dedicated time or proctorship and access to models-all 
      of which can be overcome with the newer generation of models and committed 
      trainers. Training programs should consider incorporating simulation-methods as a 
      routine component of congenital training programs.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the current research was to identify the influence of 
      university students' personality traits on their fear of COVID-19 and 
      psychological resilience levels. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional trial was 
      completed with 690 students. Descriptive statistics and correlations were 
      calculated, and a path analysis was employed with the objective of assessing the 
      model fit and investigating direct and indirect impacts. FINDINGS: Among 
      personality traits, conscientiousness and neuroticism were observed to affect 
      fear of COVID-19, and conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience 
      had an effect on psychological resilience. The tested model has a good fit and 
      explains the direct effects of the study variables. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Nurses 
      should improve university students' psychological resilience by supporting them 
      with protective and improving factors. The role of the psychiatric nurse is 
      important in providing conscious and need-oriented support in extraordinary 
      events such as pandemics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nurses who provide patient care in COVID-19 intensive care have 
      witnessed that patients experience problems such as fear of death, loneliness, 
      helplessness, uncertainty, anxiety, etc. OBJECTIVE: In this study, it was aimed 
      to examine the messages written by the patients who receive treatment in the 
      COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) through letters and their feelings and 
      thoughts which they wanted to convey to their families. METHOD: This study 
      employed a qualitative research design. The sample of the study consisted of 52 
      patients admitted to the ICU. The data of the study were obtained by examining 
      the letters written by the patients who received treatment in the COVID-19 ICU 
      between April 2021 and June 2021. The researchers collected the research data 
      through document analysis, one of the qualitative research methods. FINDINGS: The 
      messages that patients in the ICU wanted to convey to their families were 
      identified as having two main themes: "emotions in the experience of illness" and 
      "views on death." The "views on death" theme included sub-themes such as fear of 
      death, the meaning of life, acceptance of death and Saying halal for the rights 
      over each other, and wills. The "emotions in the experience of illness" theme 
      included sub-themes of love, hope/ hopelessness, loneliness, and longing. 
      CONCLUSION: It is assumed that patients have the risk of encountering a variety 
      of problems during their stay in ICU due to COVID-19 and that providing good 
      physical and psychosocial care will improve the coping mechanisms of patients.

AB  - This study examines the association between physical inactivity (PI) and 
      happiness among Ghanaian older adults and whether emotional and physical-related 
      experiences (EPE) mediate the association. Data from the Aging, Health, 
      Psychological Well-being and Health-seeking Behavior Study (AgeHeaPsyWel-HeaSeeB) 
      conducted in 2016-2018 among 1201 older Ghanaians were analyzed. Happiness was 
      assessed with the self-rated and cross-culturally validated item on a 5-point 
      scale. PI was evaluated with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire 
      (IPAQ). Hierarchical linear regressions and mediation analyses were performed to 
      estimate the hypothesized associations. Results showed that PI was significantly 
      associated with lower levels of happiness (β = -0.053, p < .001) net of potential 
      confounders. The association of PI with happiness was attenuated and fully 
      mediated by pain, sleep problems, loneliness, anxiety, and boredom. Moreover, in 
      terms of the cross-level interaction effects, PI moderated the happiness-pain 
      (β = -0.029, p < .005), happiness-social isolation (β = -0.024, p < .05), and 
      happiness-boredom (β = -0.023, p < .005) associations. Our data suggest that EPE 
      may explain why PI decreases happiness in old age. Findings provide valuable 
      insight into the interventions and decisions to improve subjective well-being and 
      quality of life in old age.

AB  - This study investigates the relationships between nursing students' internet 
      addiction levels, communication skills and difficulties in emotion regulation. 
      This cross-sectional study included 463 nursing students who completed the 
      Internet Addiction Scale (IAS), Communication Skills Scale (CSS) and Difficulties 
      in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS-16). Approximately half of the nursing students 
      were risky internet users. A negative statistically significant was determined 
      between from IAS and CSS; a positive statistically significant was determined 
      between from IAS and DERS-16. It was found that internet addiction had an effect 
      of 18.6 % (R(2) = 0.186) on difficulty in emotion regulation and 0.27 % on 
      communication skills (R(2) = 0.027). The students who were in risky group in 
      internet addiction had worse communication skills and higher levels of 
      difficulties in emotion regulation.

AB  - AIMS AND BACKGROUND: continuous and effective care is needed to improve the 
      quality of life of patients with depression. The present study aimed to determine 
      the effect of nursing home care on the quality of life of patients with Major 
      Depressive Disorder. DESIGN: This is a clinical trial study in which a total of 
      50 patients with Major Depressive Disorder were recruited using convenience 
      sampling and then randomly assigned to two groups of control and intervention. 
      METHODS: Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire and the McGill 
      Quality of Life Questionnaire at three time-points of before, three months, and 
      six months after the intervention. Patients in the intervention group received 
      nursing home care in accordance with nursing process (5-6 training sessions of 
      1.5 to 2 h, one session every two weeks over three months). They also received 
      telephone follow-up. Data were analyzed with SPSS software version 16.0 using 
      independent-samples t-test, chi square and repeated measures Analysis of 
      Variance. RESULTS: The results of the present study indicated there was a 
      significant difference in the mean score of the overall quality of life and its 
      domains between the intervention and the control group at three and six months 
      after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study, it 
      was concluded that the nursing home care program can improve the quality of life 
      and its domains in patients with Major Depressive Disorder. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: According to this study, by follow up of patients with major depression 
      disorder after discharge and performing care and counseling interventions at home 
      besides routine treatment plan, it is possible to prevent re-hospitalization and 
      decrease hospitalization costs.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a physical activity 
      intervention on burden and healthy lifestyle behavior in family caregivers of 
      schizophrenia. METHOD: A randomized, controlled trial was conducted to evaluate 
      the effect of physical activity program on burden and healthy lifestyle behavior 
      in family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia. The "Physical Activity 
      Program" consisted of 5 min of warm-up activities as the initial segment, 20 min 
      of rhythmic exercises as the activity segment, 5 min of cool down exercises as 
      the final segment and 30 min of free walking. The program consisted of 8 
      sessions. The Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale and the Healthy Lifestyle Behavior 
      Scale were applied to the physical activity and control groups ahead of the 
      program's implementation. A total of 60 caregivers were randomly distributed to 
      the intervention (n = 30) and control groups (n = 30). Post-intervention 
      measurement was completed by 60 caregivers and all the caregivers completed the 
      intervention. RESULTS: Significant differences were found on the Zarit Caregiver 
      Burden Scale score and Healthy Lifestyle Behavior score between the groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Future research should examine with larger sample groups, carry out 
      interventions, and apply the physical activity intervention by targeting 
      caregivers, along with different interventions.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted 
      in major disruption to regular learning and training for medical staff. The aim 
      of this study was to compare the learning efficacy between on-site training 
      before the COVID-19 pandemic and online training during the pandemic for nurses, 
      psychologists, social workers, and occupational therapists from Southeast Asia. 
      METHOD: The current study derived data from the International Mental Health 
      Training Center Taiwan (IMHTCT) from 2018 to 2020. IMHTCT Trainees Learning 
      Effect Questionnaire (ITLEQ) scores of the medical staff and demographic 
      variables were collected. Reliability and validity of the ITLEQ were estimated. 
      The independent t-test was used to compare differences in ITLEQ scores between 
      the pre-training and post-training stages among the trainees. In addition, 
      generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the predictive effect of 
      online training on changes in ITLEQ scores over time. FINDINGS: A total of 190 
      trainees were enrolled, including 92 social workers, 16 occupation therapists, 24 
      psychologists, and 58 nurses. The reliability and validity were satisfactory. The 
      efficacy of the training programs at IMHTCT was significant for all of the 
      healthcare workers. Furthermore, better training efficacy was found in the social 
      workers and occupational therapists who received online training compared to 
      those who received on-site training. The potential efficacy of online training 
      was found in the nurses. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the importance of 
      online training for mental healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      Online training may be implemented into regular training courses in the future.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine the problems and information 
      needs of patients with bipolar disorder during the treatment process. The present 
      research is in the type of descriptive and qualitative study. In-depth individual 
      interviews were conducted with 11 volunteer patients with bipolar disorder. The 
      data collected from the interviews were evaluated using the descriptive analysis 
      method. In the study, four categories (disease onset/diagnosis stage, adherence 
      to treatment, interpersonal relationships, information needs) and nine main 
      themes (symptoms, family support, factors that positively affect treatment 
      adherence, factors that negatively affect treatment adherence, positive effects 
      of treatment, negative effects of treatment, stigmatization, treatment, disease) 
      were determined. Patients with bipolar disorder can be helped to cope with the 
      problems they experience by providing information about the disease, adherence to 
      treatment, the treatment process, and the effects of drugs.

      students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the quality of life of 
      individuals around the world, including health care professionals. There has been 
      little research that examines the role of resilience concerning the impact of 
      COVID-19 on the quality of life of nursing students. This study aimed to 
      determine how resilience influenced the quality of life among nursing students 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional research design was 
      adopted for this study. A total of two hundred sixty-eight nursing students from 
      three universities, South India responded in the web-based survey. Data was 
      collected using self-reported questionnaires in June 2021. RESULTS: Our findings 
      revealed that the participants' resilience was normal, which had a moderate 
      impact on the quality of life of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      The COVID-19 impact on QoL significantly differed with year of education 
      (F = 3.087; p < 0.02) and university (F = 6.697, p < 0.001). Bivariate analysis 
      revealed significant inverse relationships between the impact of COVID-19 on 
      quality of life with resilience (r = -0.259; p < 0.001) and perceived knowledge 
      on COVID-19(r = -0.168; p < 0.006). CONCLUSION: In our study, we found that 
      resilience had a moderate impact on the quality of life of nursing students 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is important to promote students' 
      resilience and improve their quality of life during stressful situations.

AB  - PURPOSE: High work-family conflict affects nurses' physical, mental and 
      psychological health and reduces their job satisfaction and performance. This 
      study was conducted to determine the effect of work stress experienced by nurses 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic on family life and the factors affecting work stress 
      and work-family conflict. METHOD: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was 
      conducted on 820 nurses who agreed to participate in the research working in a 
      hospital serving only patients with confirmed COVID-19 in a province in eastern 
      Turkey. RESULTS: It was found that the average PJSS score of the nurses included 
      in the study was 3.26 ± 0.56; the average WAFCS score was 3.00 ± 0.81. It was 
      found that there was a moderately positive, statistically significant 
      relationship between the PJSS and WAFCS average scores for the nurses, and the 
      impact of work stress on the levels of work-family conflict was 28 % (p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: It was determined that the work stress levels of the nurses included 
      in the study were at a level that could threaten their health, the conflict 
      levels in work-family life were high, and the conflict levels in work and family 
      life increased as the levels of work stress increased.

AB  - Nursing literature about dissociative disorders is lacking, resulting in a 
      deficit of available evidence to drive nursing practice. This study sought to 
      address this scarcity of literature by shedding light on the lived experiences of 
      nurses who directly care or have cared for this population. Participants were 
      individually interviewed along the lines of training, education, and personal 
      experiences, and responses were analyzed to uncover themes found in multiple 
      interviews. The result was a clear emphasis on improving education about the 
      unique needs of individuals with dissociative disorders in order to improve the 
      nursing care of this population.

AB  - Given the serious consequences of unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCB) among 
      adolescents, identifying factors contributing to it in this population is 
      crucial. Although gender differences have been reported as UWCB-related factors, 
      studies on weight status remain limited. Hence, using a nationally representative 
      sample, we investigated the differences in UWCB-related factors by gender and 
      weight status. Most sociodemographic, health-related behavior, psychosocial, and 
      school factors were remarkably correlated with UWCB in the normal-weight female 
      group; however, they demonstrated most inconsistent correlations in the 
      overweight female group. Overall, this study suggests that UWCB-preventing 
      interventions in adolescents should be customized by gender and weight status.

      dysregulation to substance use disorders.

AB  - An environmental risk factor for substance abuse and dependence is childhood 
      sexual abuse (CSA). We piloted an approach we developed to test the hypothesis 
      that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation from the stress of 
      CSA is a biological mediator. We based our hypothesis on the allostasis model. 
      New admissions to residential treatment for substance use disorders (N = 41) were 
      evaluated for CSA history and two HPA axis regulation measures at baseline, one 
      month, and two months. The two HPA axis regulation measures were morning cortisol 
      level and the dexamethasone suppression test. Five potential covariates were also 
      measured to increase reliability of the findings. Feasibility outcomes were 
      mostly favorable, and included rates of participation (57 %), attrition (46 % at 
      one month and 71 % at two months), and compliance with data collection procedures 
      (87 % for morning cortisol level and 84 % for the dexamethasone suppression 
      test). High attrition rates at one and two months were entirely attributable to 
      high rates of leaving treatment, an important consideration for future studies. 
      Baseline correlations among variables showed a significant negative correlation 
      between dexamethasone suppression and perceived stress, a potential covariate 
      (rho = -0.458). This finding suggests that individuals with lower stress levels 
      have better negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis, which results in the 
      benefit of lower cortisol exposure-a finding congruent with the allostasis model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The concept of mindfulness does not attract enough attention in the 
      field of health. Despite this, it is thought to be effective on the concept of 
      empathy and compassion, which have an importance in nursing practices. AIM: The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the correlation between the mindfulness, 
      empathy and compassion levels of nursing students. METHODS: This is a 
      descriptive-correlational and cross-sectional study which comprised 347 students 
      in the nursing department of a university. As data collection tools, the Mindful 
      Attention Awareness Scale, the Basic Empathy Scale and the Compassion Scale. 
      FINDINGS: The results of the study show that no significant correlation was found 
      between the mindfulness, total empathy levels and cognitive empathy levels of the 
      students, and that there was a significant negative correlation between their 
      emotional empathy levels. There was found to be a significant positive 
      correlation between their mindfulness and total compassion levels. DISCUSSION: 
      The findings of this study contribute to the literature that the mindfulness of 
      nursing students is not related to total empathy levels, but is closely related 
      to compassion levels. Some studies in the literature support these findings. 
      CONCLUSION: It is thought that knowing, teaching and developing the concepts of 
      empathy and compassion in nursing education is important for raising nurses who 
      can provide compassionate care with a high level of empathy. The practice of 
      mindfulness should always have a prominent role in nursing education. Its 
      correlation with empathy and compassion should be consistently highlighted.

AB  - Nursing is one of the most stressful and high-risk professions. It is important 
      to identify the psychological problems experienced by nurses during the COVID-19 
      pandemic and examine the relationship between these problems to devise measures 
      that can properly address them. This study examined mediating effect of work 
      stress in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and nurses' organizational 
      and professional turnover intentions. Using a cross-sectional research design, 
      this study was conducted on 486 nurses working in seven hospitals in Turkey. The 
      mean age of the participants was 35.24 ± 6.81 and 59.9 % of them were women. The 
      Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the General Work Stress Scale, and the Turnover Intention 
      Scale were used to collect data. A mediation model showed that fear of COVID-19 
      was positively associated with work stress and organizational and professional 
      turnover intentions. The model also revealed that work stress was positively 
      associated with organizational and professional turnover intentions. Furthermore, 
      the results demonstrated that fear of COVID-19 did not only have a direct effect 
      on organizational and professional turnover intentions but also had an indirect 
      effect on it via increased work stress. Findings improve our understanding of the 
      role of work stress in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and 
      organizational and professional turnover intentions. The findings are fruitful 
      for tailoring and implementing intervention programs to reduce the adverse 
      psychological impacts of COVID-19 on nurses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of postoperative delirium on the amyloid cascade of 
      Alzheimer's dementia is poorly understood. Using early postoperative plasma 
      biomarkers, we explored whether surgery and delirium are associated with changes 
      in amyloid pathways. METHODS: We analysed data from 100 participants in the 
      Interventions for Postoperative Delirium: Biomarker-3 (IPOD-B3) cohort study in 
      the USA (NCT03124303 and NCT01980511), which recruited participants aged >65 yr 
      undergoing non-intracranial surgery. We assessed the relationship between the 
      change in plasma amyloid beta ratio (AβR; Aβ42:Aβ40) and delirium incidence 
      (defined by the 3-Minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method) and severity 
      (quantified by the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98, the study's primary 
      outcome). We also tested the relationship between plasma amyloid beta and 
      intraoperative variables. RESULTS: Across all participants, the plasma AβR 
      increased from the preoperative period to postoperative Day 1 (Wilcoxon P<0.001). 
      However, this increase was not associated with delirium incidence (Wilcoxon 
      P=0.22) or peak severity after adjusting for confounders (log[incidence rate 
      ratio]=0.43; P=0.14). Postoperative Day 1 change in plasma AβR was not associated 
      with postoperative Day 1 change in plasma tau, neurofilament light, or 
      inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, 
      and IL-12), or with operative time or low intraoperative arterial pressure. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative changes in plasma amyloid do not appear to be 
      associated with postoperative delirium. Our findings do not support associations 
      of dynamic changes in amyloid with postoperative delirium. CLINICAL TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: .NCT03124303 and NCT01980511.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to gain knowledge about the impact of an extended 
      postnatal home visiting program on parents' comprehensive health literacy (CHL) 
      in multicultural, socioeconomically disadvantaged Swedish settings. METHOD: This 
      quasi-experimental study adopted a case-control sampling method recruiting 
      first-time parents through two Child Health Care Centers in Stockholm. 
      Participants were interviewed twice through structured questionnaires when their 
      child was aged between less than two months (n = 193) and 15-18 months (n = 151) 
      from October 2017 to August 2020. Analyses used linear regression models and 
      nonparametric tests. RESULTS: A subgroup of parents that needed language 
      interpreters demonstrated statistically significantly improved CHL from 
      premeasures to postmeasures within the intervention group that received an 
      extended home visiting intervention (F = 11.429; p <.001), and when compared with 
      a corresponding subgroup that received merely the ordinary Swedish Child Health 
      Care Centers program (F = 5.025; p = .027). DISCUSSION: Postnatal home visiting 
      interventions may reduce inequity in CHL for parents living in multicultural, 
      socioeconomically disadvantaged settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute cholangitis (AC) is an infection of the biliary tract secondary 
      to biliary obstruction requiring biliary drainage through endoscopic retrograde 
      cholangiopancreatography. This study aims to compare the outcome between the 
      early and delayed ERCP in patients with severe AC. METHODS: Patient with severe 
      AC due to choledocholithiasis admitted to intensive care unit were included. 
      Early ERCP was defined was as ERCP performed within 24 h following hospital 
      admission. Propensity-score matching was used to reduce the imbalance between 
      groups. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included 
      length of hospital and ICU stay, onset or persistent organ failure. RESULTS: The 
      delayed ERCP group had a higher mortality rate at 30 days (45,5 versus 13%, 
      <0.001) and at 1 year (59,7% versus 15,6%, p <0.001). Delayed ERCP had also a 
      higher rate of respiratory adverse events (54,5 versus 27,8%, p = 0,002), longer 
      ICU (7.41 versus 4.61, p = 0,004) and hospital (11,88 versus 9,22, p = 0,042) 
      length of stay. Predictors of delayed ERCP were cardiac arrythmias, liver 
      disease, creatinine value and white blood cell count at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Delays in ERCP for patients with severe AC appear to be associated with higher 
      mortality rate and prolonged ICU and hospital stays.

TI  - A Human-Centered Design Approach to SOVTE Straw Phonation Instruction.
LID - S0892-1997(23)00018-8 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Extensive research has demonstrated that straw/tube phonation 
      exercises produce positive effects on the voice quality of the user. The purpose 
      of this study was to explore pedagogical practices employed by a range of voice 
      professionals when using SOVTEs by applying human-centered design approaches to 
      examine workflow and communication between teachers and students. METHOD/DESIGN: 
      The researchers conducted a series of five participatory role-playing workshop 
      activities at a multi-disciplinary vocology conference that included 
      speech-language pathologists, voice scientists, physicians, singing teachers, 
      acting voice teachers, choral directors, and singers. Volunteers were asked to 
      assume the role of teaching or learning straw phonation exercises. The other 
      participants from each workshop were asked to provide written and verbal feedback 
      regarding the teacher/student dynamics and what they found most important and 
      relevant in terms of best practices for SOVTEs. Expert evaluators subsequently 
      provided similar feedback based on video recordings of the workshops. RESULTS: 
      While there was variability noted in teaching techniques and results, common 
      themes emerged in the analysis. Successful and unsuccessful student and teacher 
      techniques were identified by the workshop participants. Through the video 
      analysis, the research team identified themes in instructional teaching, 
      experiential learning, and straw articulation and mechanics. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      benefits of straw/tube phonation exercises on voice quality have been 
      well-established and are clear. As we continue to refine best practices in SOVTEs 
      and, in particular, straw phonation, involvement of experts in HCD as part of 
      multidisciplinary teams may lead to the eventual design of SOVTE tools that 
      provide greater precision, consistency, and effectiveness both in clinical and 
      pedagogical settings, and aid in the differentiation of SOVTE approaches within 
      the taxonomy of vocal habilitation and rehabilitation techniques.

TI  - Prognostic analysis of smoldering ATLL with skin eruptions based on genomic 
      aberrations.
LID - S0923-1811(23)00057-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2023.02.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with smoldering ATLL often present with a skin eruption due 
      to skin infiltration of ATLL cells. Although skin eruption type is known to be 
      associated with prognosis based on its pattern, it is unknown why different types 
      of skin eruptions are associated with different prognoses. OBJECTIVE: Genomic 
      analysis of patients with skin eruptions of smoldering ATLL will be performed to 
      determine the mechanism of ATLL development and its association with prognosis. 
      METHODS: DNA from skin biopsy specimens was used for targeted sequencing of 280 
      genes to examine the association between genomic variation and prognosis. 
      RESULTS: Due to the small number of smoldering ATLL patients (27 cases), we could 
      not find a clear relationship between skin eruption and prognosis in this study. 
      Genomic analysis identified 247 genomic variants (108 genes), with an average of 
      9.2 variants and 3.2 variants as driver genes. Pathway analysis of the driver 
      genes showed activation of the pathway associated with HTLV-1 infection, as well 
      as activation of the signaling pathway observed throughout ATLL. Furthermore, 
      multivariate analysis identified age>70 years and STAT3 mutation as prognostic 
      risk factors and TBL1XR1 mutation as a risk factor for progression-free survival. 
      CONCLUSION: Although the small number of patient samples did not allow us to 
      determine a prognostic association with skin eruption, STAT3 mutation was 
      identified as a prognostic risk factor for smoldering ATLL with skin eruption. 
      Further studies are needed to increase the number of patients with this disease.

AB  - The analysis of knuckle creases is part of the multifactorial assessment of 
      digital images of the hand used to assist in the identification of 
      perpetrators captured in images depicting child sexual abuse and other offending 
      behaviours. To quantify the impact of finger flexion on the appearance of the 
      dorsal knuckle creases associated with the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) 
      joint in digital images, the collection of knuckle crease images, at different 
      points of flexion, was facilitated through an app-based Citizen Science 
      project, Knuckle Down ID. A method of knuckle crease classification was adapted 
      to assess the images collected and was used to assess the impact of finger 
      flexion on the frequency of different knuckle crease features observed in manual 
      analysis. The results show that the adapted methodology had good intra-observer 
      repeatability when the entire method was assessed (ICC.81). Specifically, the 
      recording of the knuckle crease features had good inter-observer reliability 
      (ICC.99) whereas the tracing aspect of the methodology was less repeatable (DSC 
      of whole trace.24). The impact of flexion on the recorded frequency of knuckle 
      creases was shown to be significant (p = .00). However, when comparing two hands 
      at different points of flexion, only when comparing fingers held at 0⁰ vs 45⁰ 
      (p = .04) as well as fingers held at 90⁰ vs any other finger position was the 
      differences in the knuckle crease feature frequencies significant (p = .00). The 
      comparison of knuckle crease image pairs at 20⁰ of hyperflexion vs 0⁰ (p = .10) 
      and 20⁰ of hyperflexion vs 45⁰ (p = .09) showed that the difference in knuckle 
      crease feature frequencies was not significant. This has implications for 
      examiners and improves understanding of the limitations of the 1:1 comparison of 
      knuckle creases in casework evidence in which perpetrator's hands are 
      unconstrained.

AB  - Metatranscriptomics has revolutionized our ability to explore and understand 
      transcriptional programs in microbial communities. Moreover, it has enabled us to 
      gain deeper and more specific insight into the microbial activities in human gut, 
      respiratory, oral, and vaginal communities. Perhaps the most important 
      contribution of metatranscriptomics arises, however, from the analyses of 
      disease-associated communities. We review the advantages and disadvantages of 
      metatranscriptomics analyses in understanding human health and disease. We focus 
      on human tissues low in microbial biomass and conditions associated with 
      dysbiotic microbiota. We conclude that a more widespread use of 
      metatranscriptomics and increased knowledge on microbe activities will uncover 
      critical interactions between microbes and host in human health and provide 
      diagnostic basis for culturing-independent, direct functional pathogen 
      identification.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: The RELIANCE study has demonstrated the activity and safety of 
      relmacabtagene autoleucel (relma-cel) (JW Therapeutics [Shanghai] Co, Ltd, 
      Shanghai, China), a CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cell product, in 
      patients with heavily pre-treated relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (r/r 
      LBCL). This study aimed to report the updated 2-year data of the RELIANCE study. 
      METHODS: The RELIANCE study (NCT04089215) was an open-label, multi-center, 
      randomized, phase 1/2 registrational clinical trial conducted at 10 clinical 
      sites in China. Adult patients with heavily pre-treated r/r LBCL were enrolled 
      and received lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by infusion of 100 × 10(6) or 
      150 × 10(6) relma-cel. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) at 
      3 months, as assessed by investigators. Secondary endpoints were duration of 
      response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety 
      profiles. RESULTS: From November 2017 to January 2022, a total of 68 patients 
      were enrolled, and 59 patients received relma-cel infusion. As of March 29, 2022, 
      a total of 59 patients had a median follow-up of 17.9 months (range, 0.3-25.6). 
      ORR was 77.59% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.73-87.49) and complete response 
      rate was 53.45% (95% CI, 39.87-66.66). Median DoR was 20.3 months (95% CI, 
      4.86-not reached [NR]) and median PFS was 7.0 months (95% CI, 4.76-24.15). Median 
      OS was NR and 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 75.0% and 69.3%, respectively. 
      Three (5.1%) patients experienced grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome and two 
      (3.4%) patients had grade ≥3 neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The updated data of the 
      RELIANCE study demonstrate durable response with and manageable safety profile of 
      relma-cel in patients with heavily pre-treated r/r LBCL.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Roux en y anastomosis is a preferred method of biliary 
      reconstruction in liver transplantation that involves living donors or pediatric 
      patients. However, biliary stricture is a frequent and serious complication, 
      accounting for up to 40% of biliary complications in these patients. Previously, 
      we demonstrated that extraluminal delivery of adipose-derived (AD) mesenchymal 
      stromal cells (MSCs) decreased peri-biliary fibrosis and increased 
      neo-angiogenesis in a porcine model of duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis. In this 
      study, we used a porcine model of Roux en y anastomosis to evaluate the 
      beneficial impact of a novel intraluminal MSC delivery system. METHODS: Nine 
      animals were divided into three groups: no stent (group 1), bare stent (group 2) 
      and stent coated with AD-MSCs (group 3). All animals underwent cholecystectomy 
      with roux en y choledochojejunostomy. Two animals per group were followed for 4 
      weeks and one animal per group was followed for 8 weeks. Cholangiograms and blood 
      were sampled at baseline and the end of study. Biliary tissue was collected and 
      examined by Masson trichrome staining and immunohistochemical staining for MSC 
      markers (CD34 and CD44) and for neo-angiogenesis (CD31). RESULTS: Two of three 
      animals in group 1 developed an anastomotic site stricture. No strictures were 
      observed in the animals of group 2 or group 3. CD34 and CD44 staining showed that 
      AD-MSCs engrafted successfully at the anastomotic site by intraluminal delivery 
      (group 3). Furthermore, biliary tissue from group 3 showed significantly less 
      fibrosis and increased angiogenesis compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Intraluminal delivery of AD-MSCs resulted in successful biliary engraftment of 
      AD-MSCs as well as reduced peri-biliary fibrosis and increased neo-angiogenesis.

AB  - Theories of consciousness are often based on the assumption that a single, 
      unified neurobiological account will explain different types of conscious 
      awareness. However, recent findings show that, even within a single modality such 
      as conscious visual perception, the anatomical location, timing, and information 
      flow of neural activity related to conscious awareness vary depending on both 
      external and internal factors. This suggests that the search for generic neural 
      correlates of consciousness may not be fruitful. I argue that consciousness 
      science requires a more pluralistic approach and propose a new framework: joint 
      determinant theory (JDT). This theory may be capable of accommodating different 
      brain circuit mechanisms for conscious contents as varied as percepts, wills, 
      memories, emotions, and thoughts, as well as their integrated experience.

LID - 10.1016/j.cllc.2023.01.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the association between elevated C-reactive 
      protein (CRP) and clinical outcomes among adults treated with surgery for 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the US. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults with 
      NSCLC who underwent lung cancer surgery and had ≥1 CRP measurement prior to, or 
      >1 month following, index surgery were identified in the Optum Clinformatics 
      claims database. The association between elevated CRP (>10 mg/L) and risk of 
      NSCLC recurrence/death was assessed separately during the 6 months before surgery 
      (pre surgery cohort) and 2 years following surgery (post-surgery cohort) using 
      multivariate regressions and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: After adjusting for 
      baseline demographic and clinical characteristics among patients in the pre 
      surgery cohort with index surgery between 2016 to 2020 (n = 104), the incidence 
      rate ratio (IRR) for NSCLC recurrence between elevated vs. non-elevated CRP was 
      2.17 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.03-4.60; P = .04). In the post surgery 
      cohort (n = 264), the adjusted IRR for disease recurrence (elevated vs. 
      non-elevated CRP) was 2.22 (95% CI=1.05-4.70; P = .04). In the pre surgery 
      cohort, the odds of death were nearly two-fold (odds ratio [OR]=1.91; 95% 
      CI=1.06-3.42; P = .03) among patients with elevated CRP. In the post surgery 
      cohort, the OR was 1.62 (95% CI=0.88-2.97; P = .12). Among those with 
      persistently elevated CRP prior to surgery, there was a significant overall trend 
      of increased CRP over the 5-year period. CONCLUSION: These results support the 
      association between elevated CRP and a higher risk of NSCLC recurrence/death in 
      pre- and postsurgery cohorts. This study may shed lights on 
      inflammation-suppressing treatments in patients with NSCLC.

TI  - ANGPT2/CAV1 regulates albumin transcytosis of glomerular endothelial cells under 
      high glucose exposure and is impaired by losartan.
LID - S2013-2514(23)00031-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.nefroe.2022.11.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microalbuminuria is a common clinical symptom that manifests in the 
      early stages of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and is also the main feature of 
      glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) injury. There is increasing evidence that the 
      transcytosis of albumin across GECs is closely related to the formation of 
      albuminuria. Our previous studies have shown that angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) can 
      inhibit albumin transcytosis across renal tubular epithelial cells by activating 
      caveolin 1 (CAV1) phosphorylation during high glucose (HG) exposure. The role of 
      ANGPT2 in albumin transcytosis across GECs remains unclear. Losartan 
      significantly reduces albuminuria, but the mechanism has not been clarified. 
      METHODS: We established an in vitro albumin transcytosis model to investigate the 
      change in albumin transcytosis across human renal glomerular endothelial cells 
      (hrGECs) under normal glucose (NG), high glucose (HG) and losartan intervention. 
      We knocked down ANGPT2 and CAV1 to evaluate their roles in albumin transcytosis 
      across hrGECs and verified the relationship between them. In vivo, DKD mouse 
      models were established and treated with different doses of losartan. 
      Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expression of 
      ANGPT2 and CAV1. RESULTS: In vitro, the transcytosis of albumin across hrGECs was 
      significantly increased under high glucose stimulation, and losartan inhibited 
      this process. The expression of ANGPT2 and CAV1 were both increased in hrGECs 
      under HG conditions and losartan intervention reduced the expression of them. 
      Moreover, ANGPT2 downregulation reduced albumin transcytosis in hrGECs by 
      regulating CAV1 expression. In vivo, the expression of ANGPT2 and CAV1 in the 
      glomerulus was both increased significantly in DKD mice. Compared with DKD mice, 
      losartan treatment reduced albuminuria and decreased the expression of ANGPT2 and 
      CAV1 in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: ANGPT2 exacerbated albumin 
      transcytosis across GECs by increasing CAV1 expression during HG exposure, 
      thereby increasing albuminuria. Losartan reduces albumin transcytosis and 
      albuminuria formation in DKD by inhibiting the upregulation of ANGPT2 under HG 
      conditions. Our findings suggest that ANGPT2 and CAV1 may be novel therapeutic 
      targets for diabetic albuminuria. In addition, we provide new evidence to 
      elaborate on the mechanism of losartan in the development of DKD.

AB  - Over recent years many statisticians and researchers have highlighted that 
      statistical inference would benefit from a better use and understanding of 
      hypothesis testing, p-values, and statistical significance. We highlight three 
      recommendations in the context of biochemical sciences. First recommendation: to 
      improve the biological interpretation of biochemical data, do not use p-values 
      (or similar test statistics) as thresholded values to select biomolecules. Second 
      recommendation: to improve comparison among studies and to achieve robust 
      knowledge, perform complete reporting of data. Third recommendation: statistical 
      analyses should be reported completely with exact numbers (not as asterisks or 
      inequalities). Owing to the high number of variables, a better use of statistics 
      is of special importance in omic studies.

AB  - Although herbicide drift is a common side effect of herbicide application in 
      agroecosystems, its effects on the ecology and evolution of natural communities 
      are rarely studied. A recent shift to dicamba, a synthetic auxin herbicide known 
      for 'drifting' to nontarget areas, necessitates the examination of drift effects 
      on the plant-insect interactions that drive eco-evo dynamics in weed communities. 
      We review current knowledge of direct effects of synthetic auxin herbicides on 
      plant-insect interactions, focusing on plant herbivory, and discuss potential 
      indirect effects, which are cascading effects on organisms that interact with 
      herbicide-exposed plants. We end by developing a framework for the study of 
      plant-insect interactions given drift, highlighting potential changes to plant 
      developmental timing, resource quantity, quality, and cues.

AB  - OX40 is an important costimulatory molecule for T-cell expansion and survival. 
      Because OX40 is expressed on most T-cell subsets, it is an attractive therapeutic 
      target for a variety of T-cell‒mediated diseases. Clinical trials are already 
      underway for some skin inflammatory diseases. In this review, we present various 
      observations that improve our understanding of how OX40-targeted therapy can be 
      applied for skin inflammatory diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, 
      T helper (Th)2- and Th17-mediated diseases, respectively. The important 
      OX40/OX40L-mediated interaction between T cells and other immune cells is also 
      discussed in terms of skin autoimmune diseases, such as alopecia areata and 
      pemphigus. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) highly express OX40, and the skin harbors a 
      large Treg population; thus, understanding how OX40-targeted treatment acts on 
      Tregs is vital for the development of therapeutic strategies for various skin 
      diseases.

AB  - Women increasingly participate in outdoor activities in wilderness and remote 
      environments. We performed a literature review to address diagnostic and 
      therapeutic considerations during first-trimester pregnancy for remote multiday 
      travel. Pretrip planning for pregnant patients traveling outside access to 
      advanced medical care should include performing a transvaginal ultrasound to 
      confirm pregnancy location and checking D rhesus status. We discuss the risk of 
      potential travel-related infections and recommended vaccinations prior to 
      departure based on destination. Immediate evacuation to definitive medical care 
      is required for patients with a pregnancy of unknown location and vaginal 
      bleeding. We propose algorithms for determining the need for evacuation and 
      present therapeutic options for nausea and vomiting, urinary tract infections, 
      and candidiasis in the field.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the pharmacist's contributions by analyzing potentially 
      inappropriate prescription and home treatment reconciliation in the complex 
      chronic patient unit of a tertiary hospital. METHOD: Observational, prospective, 
      multidisciplinary study of patients in the complex chronic patient unit of a 
      hospital during February 2019-June 2020. Multidisciplinary team of the complex 
      chronic developed a checklist with a selection of non-recommended drugs based on 
      STOPP/START, Beers and Priscus criteria, and drugs susceptible to deprescription 
      according to LESS-CHRON criteria. The pharmacist applied the checklist daily in 
      patients admitted to the unit, in addition to reconciling home treatment by 
      reviewing the prescribed treatment with that detailed in the electronic home 
      prescription. Therefore, the following variables were collected: age, sex and 
      number of drugs on admission as independent variables, and dependent variables: 
      number of drugs at discharge, type of potentially inappropriate prescription, 
      reasons for reconciliation, drugs involved and degree of acceptance of the 
      recommendation by the prescribing physician to assess the pharmaceutical 
      contribution. The statistical analysis was performed with IBM® SPSS® 
      Statistics22. RESULTS: We reviewed 621 patients with a median age of 84 years 
      (56.4% women), and intervention was performed in 218 (35.1%). The median number 
      of drugs was 11 (2-26) at admission and 10 (0-25) at discharge. 373 interventions 
      were performed: 235 for medication reconciliation (78.3% accepted), 71 for 
      non-recommended drugs (57.7% accepted), 42 for deprescription (61.9% accepted) 
      and 25 for other reasons. Statistically significant differences were observed 
      between the number of drugs at discharge and at admission in both intervention 
      patients (n = 218) and complex chronic patients (n = 114) (p < 0.001 in both 
      cases). Moreover, statistically significant differences were observed in the 
      number of drugs at admission between patients included in the complex chronic 
      programme and those not included (p = 0.001), and in the number of drugs at 
      discharge (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The integration of the pharmacist in the 
      multidisciplinary team of the complex chronic patient unit improves patient 
      safety and quality of care. The selected criteria were useful for detecting 
      inappropriate drugs in this population and favored deprescription.

AB  - Dialysis care in the United States is expensive and is mostly paid for by 
      Medicare. To reduce the cost of providing dialysis services, the federal 
      government has relied on a law that designates Medicare as a secondary payer in 
      the first 30 months of dialysis. During this period, private health insurers are 
      the primary payer and pay for the majority of dialysis-related costs. Private 
      health insurers often pay substantially higher prices for dialysis care than does 
      Medicare, possibly due to highly concentrated dialysis-provider markets. A 
      perspective by Boumil and Curfmin in this journal discusses how a recent ruling 
      by the US Supreme Court may limit Medicare's role as a secondary payer, 
      potentially altering the economic relationship between dialysis providers and 
      private insurers. Boumil and Curfmin discuss how these changes may ultimately 
      promote competition in dialysis-provider markets and lower dialysis-related costs 
      paid by private health insurers. We compare this viewpoint to responses and 
      concerns voiced by other stakeholders in the kidney-care community and outline 
      additional ways in which the Supreme Court's ruling may affect competition in 
      dialysis markets and prices paid for dialysis by private insurers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established treatment for 
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) improving quality of life, motor, and 
      non-motor symptoms. However, non-motor effects in PD subtypes are understudied. 
      We hypothesized that patients with 'postural instability and gait difficulty' 
      (PIGD) experience more beneficial non-motor effects than 'tremor-dominant' 
      patients undergoing DBS for PD. METHODS: In this prospective, observational, 
      international multicentre study with a 6-month follow-up, we assessed the 
      Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS) as primary and the following secondary outcomes: 
      Unified PD Rating Scale-motor examination (UPDRS-III), Scales for Outcomes in PD 
      (SCOPA)-activities of daily living (ADL) and -motor complications, 
      PDQuestionnaire-8 (PDQ-8), and levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD). We analysed 
      within-group longitudinal changes with Wilcoxon signed-rank test and 
      Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. Additionally, we explored 
      outcome between-group differences of motor subtypes with Mann-Whitney U-tests. 
      RESULTS: In 82 PIGD and 33 tremor-dominant patients included in this study, 
      baseline NMSS total scores were worse in PIGD patients, both groups experienced 
      postoperative improvements of the NMSS sleep/fatigue domain, and between-group 
      differences in postoperative outcomes were favourable in the PIGD group for the 
      NMSS total and miscellaneous domain scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides 
      evidence of a favourable outcome of total non-motor burden in PIGD compared to 
      tremor-dominant patients undergoing DBS for PD. These differences of clinical 
      efficacy on non-motor aspects should be considered when advising and monitoring 
      patients with PD undergoing DBS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in 
      patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), coincides with less physical 
      activity. Cognitive trainings (CT) have been found to promote laboratory 
      environment-based movement. Knowledge about their effect in natural home-based 
      environment, reflecting everyday function, is sparse. This explorative study 
      investigated short-term effects of CT on physical activity assessed by home-based 
      accelerometry, and its relation to change of cognitive function over time and 
      non-cognitive outcomes in patients with PD-MCI. Cognitive and non-cognitive 
      correlates of movement parameters at pretest were evaluated as well. METHODS: 
      Eighteen patients with PD-MCI of the TrainParC study were analyzed. Those 
      patients received either a 6-week multidomain group CT or physical training (PT). 
      Physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed with wearable 
      accelerometers worn up to seven days pre- and post-training. RESULTS: Patients in 
      the CT group displayed significantly greater increases in active periods after 
      training than patients assigned to PT. In the CT group, increases in executive 
      functioning were associated with increases in active periods and decreases in 
      active mean bout length after training. At pretest, reduced working memory 
      correlated with longer sedentary mean bout length, and impairment in activities 
      of daily living (ADL) correlated with a higher number of sedentary periods. 
      CONCLUSION: Study data revealed that CT can increase physical activity in 
      patients with PD-MCI, possibly due to effects on executive functions, which needs 
      further investigation in larger sample sizes. Lower working memory performance 
      and ADL impairment might be associated with a more inactive lifestyle in patients 
      with PD-MCI.

AB  - The introduction of transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI) has greatly 
      benefited the management of right ventricular outflow tract dysfunction. 
      Infective endocarditis (IE) is a feared complication of TPVI that affects valve 
      durability and patient outcomes. Current recommendations provide only limited 
      guidance on the management of IE after TPVI (TPVI-IE). This article, by a group 
      of experts in congenital heart disease in children and adults, interventional 
      cardiology, infectious diseases including IE, and microbiology, provides a 
      comprehensive review of the current evidence on TPVI-IE, including its incidence, 
      risk factors, causative organisms, diagnosis, and treatment. The incidence of 
      TPVI-IE varies from 13-91/1000 person-years for Melody valves to 8-17/1000 
      person-years for SAPIEN valves. Risk factors include history of IE, DiGeorge 
      syndrome, immunosuppression, male sex, high residual transpulmonary gradient and 
      portal of bacteria entry. Staphylococci and streptococci are the most common 
      culprits, whereas Staphylococcus aureus is associated with the most severe 
      disease. In addition to the modified Duke criteria, a high residual gradient 
      warrants a strong suspicion. Imaging studies are helpful for the diagnosis. 
      Intravenous antibiotics guided by blood culture results are the mainstay of 
      treatment. Invasive re-intervention may be required. TPVI-IE in patients with 
      congenital heart disease exhibits several distinctive features. Whether specific 
      valve types are associated with a higher risk of TPVI-IE requires further 
      investigation. Patient and parent education regarding IE prevention may have a 
      role to play and should be offered to all patients.

TI  - Colorectal Cancer Screening Disparities Among Race: A Zip Code Level Analysis.
LID - S1533-0028(23)00002-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clcc.2023.01.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening can prevent disease by early 
      identification. Existing disparities in CRC screening have been associated with 
      factors including race, socioeconomic status, insurance, and even geography. Our 
      study takes a deeper look into how social determinants related to zip code 
      tabulation areas affect CRC screenings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective cross-sectional study of CRC screenings by race at a zip code 
      level, evaluating for impactful social determinant factors such as the social 
      deprivation index (SDI). We used publicly available data from CDC 500 Cities 
      Project (2016-2019), PLACES Project (2020), and the American Community Survey 
      (2019). We conducted multivariate and confirmatory factor analyses among race, 
      income, health insurance, check-up visits, and SDI. RESULTS: Increasing the 
      tertile of SDI was associated with a higher likelihood of being Black or 
      Hispanic, as well as decreased median household income (P < .01). Lower rates of 
      regular checkup visits were found in the third tertile of SDI (P < .01). The 
      multivariate analysis showed that being Black, Hispanic, lower income, being 
      uninsured, lack of regular check-ups, and increased SDI were related to decreased 
      CRC screening. In the confirmatory factor analysis, we found that SDI and access 
      to insurance were the variables most related to decreased CRC screening. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results reveal the top 2 factors that impact a locality's CRC 
      screening rates are the social deprivation index and access to health care. This 
      data may help implement interventions targeting social barriers to further 
      promote CRC screenings within disadvantaged communities and decrease overall 
      mortality via early screening.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation of abattoirs with no Hazard Analysis Critical Control 
      Point plan in Tucumán, Argentina.

AB  - This work focused on the comprehensive study of two provincial transit abattoirs 
      in Tucumán, Argentina, with no Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) 
      plan. Visits (n=20) were conducted between 2016 and 2018 during the operational 
      and post-operational processes. Risk was estimated and the bacteriological 
      analysis of carcass and environmental samples was performed. Risk estimation 
      showed the predominance of high risk in both abattoirs. The main deviations from 
      the HACCP plan were: deficient building conditions, deficient workflow, lack of 
      sectorization of changing rooms and bathrooms, lack of implementation of 
      Standardized Sanitary Operational Procedures, and no food safety training of 
      workers. The counts of indicator microorganisms from both abattoirs were not 
      significant. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 7.5% carcass and 7.3% 
      environmental samples. The Salmonella serovars identified were Cerro, Corvallis, 
      Havana and Agona. Shiga toxin (stx) genes were detected in 24.4% carcass and 
      30.9% environmental samples. The isolates were characterized as Escherichia coli 
      O8:H7/stx(1), O116:H49/stx(2) and O136:H40/stx(2). Based on these results, it 
      would be possible to implement an improvement plan in Tucumán abattoirs together 
      with the local health authorities. Still, the need to work jointly with the 
      sanitary authority in search of a unique sanitary standard for Argentina remains 
      unaddressed.

TI  - PV Isolation Using a Spherical Array PFA Catheter: Preclinical Assessment and 
      Comparison to Radiofrequency Ablation.

LID - 10.1016/j.jacep.2023.01.022 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A multielectrode spherical array catheter capable of single-shot 
      mapping and ablation has been introduced. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to 
      compare the efficacy and safety of circumferential, linear, and focal ablation 
      using either microsecond pulsed field (PF) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation in 
      preclinical model. METHODS: Under general anesthesia, a 122 gold-plated 
      multielectrode array was introduced into the left atrium. Twenty-nine canines 
      underwent isolation of two pulmonary veins (PVs), with linear and focal left 
      atrial ablation with both RF (n = 12) and PF (n = 17). PF was also delivered 
      within the superior vena cava and atop the esophagus in three swine. Animals were 
      sacrificed acutely (immediately for RF [6 of 12] and 3 days for PF [6 of 17]) and 
      the remaining (n = 17) at 14 to 30 days. Detailed necropsy and histopathology 
      were performed. RESULTS: All PVs were acutely (58 of 58) and durably (34 of 34) 
      isolated and exhibited wide confluent lesions. Lesions were transmural for 97% to 
      100% of sections with depths of 2.5 to 3.4 mm and 2.5 to 3.5 mm in the acute and 
      chronic cohorts, respectively. Linear and focal lesions displayed transmurality 
      rates of 85% to 100% with depths of 3.5 millimeters to 4.2 millimeters in the 
      acute cohort. In the chronic cohorts, linear lesions created with RF, PF+RF, and 
      PF had no significant differences in depth (3.5 ± 1.8 millimeters, 4.0 ± 1.4 
      millimeters, and 3.9 ± 0.9 millimeters) or transmurality (83.3%, 100%, and 80%). 
      Current of injury was seen on local unipolar electrogram immediately after PF and 
      RF, and this occurred to a wider extent with PF. PF but not RF elicited 
      bradycardia from ganglionated plexi stimulation. There were no instances of 
      phrenic palsy, venous stenosis, esophageal damage, or thromboembolism. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Circumferential, linear, and focal mapping and ablation can be 
      achieved with this novel catheter using both PF and RF, with excellent efficacy 
      and safety.

TI  - IgG4 expression and IgG4/IgG ratio in the tumour invasion front predict long-term 
      outcomes for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

AB  - IgG4-positive plasma cells are reportedly increased in the tumour 
      microenvironment, and a high number of these cells in tumours is a poor 
      prognostic factor in several cancers. However, there are no reported analyses of 
      IgG4 expression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). This study aimed to 
      analyse the correlations between prognosis-related clinicopathological features 
      of patients with ICC and IgG4 expression. We identified 37 ICC patients who 
      underwent surgical resection between January 2010 and December 2020. The number 
      of IgG-positive and IgG4-positive plasma cells in the tumour, invasion front, and 
      stroma near the tumour was analysed by immunostaining. Furthermore, we examined 
      the association of prognosis-related clinicopathological data with the number of 
      IgG4-positive plasma cells and IgG4/IgG ratio in ICC patients. The IgG4-positive 
      plasma cell percentages for the intra-tumour area, invasion front, and 
      non-cancerous area (NCA) near the tumour were 91.9%, 56.8%, and 81.1%, 
      respectively. IgG-positive plasma cells were observed in each region for all 
      cases, except for NCA tissue in one case. A high IgG4 expression level and 
      IgG4/IgG ratio in the invasion front were significantly associated with poor 
      overall survival (OS) (log-rank test p=0.0438 and p=0.0338, respectively). 
      Multivariate analysis for OS revealed that high IgG4 expression (p=0.0140), lymph 
      node metastasis (p=0.0205), and positive surgical margin (p=0.0009) or a high 
      IgG4/IgG ratio (p=0.0051), lymph node metastasis (p=0.0280), and positive 
      surgical margin (p=0.0009) were independent poor prognostic factors. In 
      conclusion, a high IgG4 expression level and IgG4/IgG ratio in the invasion front 
      are independent poor prognostic factors for ICC. Targeted therapy for IgG4 may 
      improve the prognosis for patients with ICC.

LID - 10.1016/j.pathol.2022.11.009 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in the management of diffuse pleural mesothelioma (DPM) have 
      increased interest in prognostication and risk stratification on the basis that 
      maximum benefit of combination immunotherapy appears to be seen in patients who 
      otherwise would have the worst prognosis. Various grading schemes have been 
      proposed, including the recently published Mesothelioma Weighted Grading Scheme 
      (MWGS). However, predictive modelling using deep learning algorithms is 
      increasingly regarded as the gold standard in prognostication. We therefore 
      sought to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram for DPM. Data from 369 
      consecutive patients with DPM were used as independent training and validation 
      cohorts to develop a prognostic tool that included the following variables: age, 
      sex, histological type, nuclear atypia, mitotic count, necrosis, and BAP1 
      immunohistochemistry. Patients were stratified into four risk groups to assess 
      model discrimination and calibration. To assess discrimination, the 
      area-under-the-curve (AUC) of a receiver-operator-curve (ROC), concordance-index 
      (C-index), and dissimilarity index (D-index) were calculated. Based on the 5-year 
      ROC analysis, the AUC for our model was 0.75. Our model had a C-index of 0.67 
      (95% CI 0.53-0.79) and a D-index of 2.40 (95% CI 1.69-3.43). Our prognostic 
      nomogram for DPM is the first of its kind, incorporates well established 
      prognostic markers, and demonstrates excellent predictive capability. As these 
      factors are routinely assessed in most pathology laboratories, it is hoped that 
      this model will help inform prognostication and difficult management decisions, 
      such as patient selection for novel therapies. This nomogram is now freely 
      available online at: https://nomograms.shinyapps.io/Meso_Cox_ML/.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether significant loss in ipsilateral 
      renal parenchymal volume (IRPV) and renal function occurs during active 
      surveillance (AS) of renal oncocytoma (RO) patients. METHODS: Renal function 
      (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR) dynamics were retrospectively 
      analyzed in 32 consecutive biopsy-diagnosed RO patients managed with AS at a 
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network institute. Three-dimensional kidney and 
      tumor reconstructions were generated and IRPV was calculated using volumetry 
      software (Myrian®) for all patients with manually estimated RO growth >+10 cm(3). 
      GFR and IRPV were compared at AS initiation vs. the last follow-up using 2-sided 
      paired t-tests. The correlation between change in IRPV and change in RO size or 
      GFR was tested using a Spearman coefficient. RESULTS: With median follow-up of 37 
      months, there was no significant change between initial vs. last eGFR (median 
      71.0 vs. 70.5 ml/min/1.73 m(2), P = 0.50; median change -3.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). 
      Among patients (n = 17) with RO growth >+10 cm(3) during AS (median growth +28.6 
      cm(3), IQR +16.9- + 46.5 cm(3)), IRPV generally remained stable (median change 
      +0.5%, IQR -1.2%- + 1.2%), with only 2 cases surpassing 5% loss. No IRPV loss was 
      detected among any patient within the top tertile of RO growth magnitude. RO 
      growth magnitude did not correlate with loss of either IRPV (ρ = -0.30, P = 0.24) 
      or eGFR (ρ = -0.16, P = 0.40), including among patient subsets with lower initial 
      eGFR. Study limitations include a lack of long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Volumetry is a promising novel tool to measure kidney and tumor tissue changes 
      during AS. Our study using volumetry indicates that clinically significant loss 
      of IRPV or eGFR is uncommon and unrelated to tumor growth among untreated RO 
      patients with intermediate follow-up. These findings support that AS is in 
      general functionally safe for RO patients, however longer study is needed to 
      determine safety durability, particularly among uncommon ≥cT2 RO variants.

TI  - Use of a physical activity monitor to track perioperative activity of radical 
      cystectomy patients our first glimpse at what our patients are doing before and 
      after surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: To optimize recovery after radical cystectomy (RC), providers stress the 
      importance of ambulation and adequate rest. However, little is known about the 
      activity and sleep habits of patients undergoing RC. Therefore, we utilized a 
      wearable physical activity monitor (PAM) in the perioperative period to provide 
      the first objective data on physical activity and sleep habits for RC patients. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively identified patients ≥60 years old with 
      planned RC. Participants completed a 4-week prehabilitation exercise program 
      prior to surgery. They wore a PAM for 7-day intervals: at baseline, after 
      prehabilitation, at postoperative day (POD) 30 and POD90. We tracked physical 
      activity via metabolic equivalents (METs). METs were categorized by intensity: 
      light (MET 1.5-<3), moderate (MET 3-<6), and vigorous (MET ≥6). We calculated 
      daily step totals. We tracked hours slept and number of sleep awakenings. We 
      correlated activity and sleep with self-reported quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: 
      Forty-two patients completed prehabilitation and RC. Moderate intensity exercise 
      decreased at POD30 (61 minutes/d at baseline, 30 minutes/d at POD30, P = 0.005). 
      Physical activity did not significantly differ for light or vigorous activity at 
      any timepoint. RC did not significantly affect sleep. Sleep and physical activity 
      were associated with mental and physical QOL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is 
      the first study utilizing patient-worn monitors in RC to track physical activity 
      and sleep. This study gives patients and providers a better understanding of 
      postcystectomy recovery expectations. With these results in mind, interventions 
      may be implemented to optimize activity and sleep in the perioperative period.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) are rare diseases usually 
      presenting with renal, haematological, neurologic and cardiovascular involvement 
      and nonspecific but severe symptoms. A registry of TMA cases managed in Spanish 
      paediatric intensive care units (the MATUCIP Registry) was established with the 
      aim of gaining knowledge on their clinical characteristics, diagnosis and 
      acute-phase treatment. METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicentre 
      observational study in 20 paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in Spain from 
      January 2017 to December 2021 in children aged more than 1 month with TMAs, who 
      were followed up through the discharge from the PICU. RESULTS: The sample 
      included 97 patients (51.5% female) with a median age of 2.6 years (interquartile 
      range [IQR], 1.6-5.7). The initial manifestations were gastrointestinal (74.2%), 
      respiratory (14.4%), fever (5.2%), neurologic (3.1%) and other (3.1%). At 
      admission, 75.3% of patients had microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, 95.9% 
      thrombocytopenia and 94.8% acute kidney injury. Of the total sample, 57.7% of 
      patients received a diagnosis of Shiga toxin-associated haemolytic uraemic 
      syndrome (HUS), 14.4% of Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated HUS, 15.6% of 
      atypical HUS, 10.3% of secondary TMA and 2.1% of thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
      purpura. Eighty-seven patients (89.7%) developed arterial hypertension, and 49.5% 
      gastrointestinal, 22.7% respiratory, 25.8% neurologic and 12.4% cardiac 
      manifestations. Also, 60.8% required renal replacement therapy and 2.1% plasma 
      exchange. Twenty patients received eculizumab. The median PICU stay was 8.5 days 
      (IQR, 5-16.5). Two children died. CONCLUSIONS: The MATUCIP registry demonstrates 
      the clinical variability of TMA cases requiring admission to the PICU. Knowledge 
      of the presentation and outcomes of TMAs can facilitate early aetiological 
      diagnosis. This registry can help improve our understanding of the clinical 
      spectrum of these diseases, for which there is a dearth of published data.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Suicidal behaviour and self-harm are increasing in children and 
      adolescents. Non-suicidal self-harm are a dysfunctional method of emotional 
      regulation, and it must be distinguished from suicidal behaviours. METHODS: 
      Narrative review of the current situation on suicide and self-harm in Spain. 
      Descriptive study of suicidal behaviours in paediatric emergencies. RESULTS: 
      Mental health consultations were analysed (March-2019 to March-2020 and 
      March-2020 to March-2021) in a multicentric study of the SEUP (Spanish Society of 
      Pediatric Emergencies), finding a 122 % increase of the diagnosis of 
      "non-accidental drug intoxication" and 56 % of "suicide/suicide attempt/suicidal 
      ideation". In another prospective analysis, 281 attempts were recorded, with the 
      patient profile being: female (90.1 %), 14.8 years old, 34.9 % without previous 
      psychiatric diagnosis; 57.7% with previous suicidal behaviour. The presence of 
      psychiatric disorders, especially depression, and previous attempts, are the 
      best-known risk factors for suicidal behaviour, although other factors are 
      involved (family, personal or social). Pediatricians should be trained to deal 
      with questions about suicide and acquire the skills to conduct an interview with 
      a supportive and empathetic attitude. In Spain, suicide prevention plans are 
      heterogeneous among communities, and there is not a unified national suicide 
      prevention plan. CONCLUSIONS: Primary, hospital and mental health care resources 
      for paediatric population should be strengthened to prevent suicidal behaviours. 
      Specific training for school staff, and child and adolescent psychiatry training 
      for paediatricians and nurses are crucial in the prevention of suicide in 
      children and adolescent population.

TI  - Additive and Interactive Effects of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and persistent tic 
      disorder (PTD) are two neurodevelopmental disorders that frequently co-occur. 
      Contributions of each disorder to cognitive and behavioral deficits have been 
      reported. In this paper, we tested 3 models of pathophysiology for the two 
      disorders (additive, interactive, and phenotypic) using resting-state 
      connectivity associated with each disorder separately and together. METHODS: 
      Participants were 148 children (55 with ADHD only, 33 with ADHD and PTD, 27 with 
      PTD only, and 33 healthy control subjects) at ages 8 to 12 years. Following 
      diagnostic interviews and behavioral assessment, participants underwent a 
      128-channel electroencephalography recording. Resting-state, cortical 
      source-level effective connectivity was analyzed across the 4 groups using a 2 × 
      2 factorial design with factors of ADHD (with/without) and PTD (with/without). 
      RESULTS: ADHD diagnosis was the primary driver of cognitive and behavioral 
      deficits, while deficits associated with PTD were primarily with thought problems 
      and internalizing problems when compared with controls. Subadditive effects were 
      observed in co-occurring ADHD+PTD for parent-rated behavioral problems and 
      cognitive functions. Aberrant effective connectivity was primarily associated 
      with ADHD, more specifically with lower posterior and occipital-frontal 
      connectivity, while children with PTD exhibited greater left postcentral to 
      precuneus connectivity. Weaker ADHD-related connectivity was associated with more 
      severe behavioral problems, including internalizing behaviors, thought problems, 
      and working memory deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to general behavioral deficits, 
      aberrant resting-state neural connectivity in pediatric ADHD and PTD combines 
      additively in co-occurring cases. The findings of this study support ADHD as a 
      focus of treatment in comorbid cases, given the driving role of ADHD in both 
      behavioral and neurophysiological deficits.

AB  - Polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are produced from a variety of industrial 
      sources, and they reach the aquatic ecosystems by the dry-wet deposition from the 
      atmosphere and also by the drainage from the land surfaces. Then the PCNs can be 
      transmitted through the food chain to humans and show toxic effects on different 
      aquatic animals as well as humans. Considering this scenario, it is an obligatory 
      task to explore the toxicity data of PCNs more deeply for the species of an 
      aquatic ecosystem (green algae-Daphnia magna-fish), and to extrapolate those data 
      for humans. But the toxicity data for different aquatic species are quite 
      limited. The laboratory experimentations are complicated and ethically 
      troublesome to fill toxicity data gaps; therefore, different in silico methods 
      (e.g., QSAR, quantitative read-across predictions) are emerging as crucial ways 
      to fill the data gaps and hazard assessments. In the present study, we developed 
      individual toxicity models as well as interspecies models from the 75 PCN 
      toxicity data against three aquatic species (green algae-Daphnia magna-fish) by 
      employing easily interpretable 2D descriptors; these models were validated 
      rigorously employing different globally accepted internal and external validation 
      metrics. Then we interpreted the modelled descriptors mechanistically with the 
      endpoint values for better understanding. And finally, we endeavored to improve 
      the prediction quality in terms of external validation metrics by employing a 
      novel quantitative read-across approach by pooling the descriptors from the 
      developed individual QSAR models.

AB  - Therapeutic apheresis is an extracorporeal treatment that selectively removes 
      abnormal cells or harmful substances in the blood that are associated with or 
      cause certain diseases. During the last decades the application of therapeutic 
      apheresis has expanded to a broad spectrum of hematological and non-hematological 
      diseases due to various studies on the clinical efficacy of this procedure. In 
      this context there are more than 30 centers performing therapeutic apheresis and 
      registered in the apheresis database in Turkey. Herein, we, The Turkish Apheresis 
      Registry, aimed to analyze some key articles published so far from Turkey 
      regarding the use of apheresis for various indications.

AB  - The purpose is to evaluate the trends in MR arthrogram utilization at a tertiary 
      care academic institution and to determine if there are factors that can be 
      implicated in the utilization trends. Number of MR arthrograms of the shoulder, 
      hip, and elbow from 2013-2020 at our institution were identified (n = 1882). 
      Patient demographics including age, sex, sports participation, history of prior 
      surgery, and physician referral were obtained. Descriptive statistics were 
      performed to determine the prevalence of MR arthrograms. Linear regression 
      analyses were performed to determine the relationship of time with prevalence of 
      arthrograms. Chi-square tests and posthoc analyses with Bonferroni correction 
      were used to assess if categorical variables were different between the years. 
      There was overall decrease in the prevalence of MR arthrograms of the shoulder, 
      hip, and elbow despite an increase in the overall MR volume during the study 
      period. Linear regression models significantly predicated decrease in arthrogram 
      prevalence with each passing year (P < 0.001). The percentage of orthopedic 
      referrals for arthrograms in the hip (P = 0.002) and shoulder (P = < 0.001) 
      decreased significantly towards the end of the study period. None of the other 
      variables assessed were significant. At our tertiary care academic institution, 
      arthrogram utilization has been drastically decreasing over the past 8 years. The 
      percentage of orthopedic referrals for shoulder and hip arthrograms significantly 
      decreased at the end of the study period.

TI  - A randomized phase I/II safety and immunogenicity study of the 
      Montanide-adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-RBD-Fc vaccine, AKS-452.
LID - S0264-410X(23)00200-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2023.02.057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous interim data from a phase I study of AKS-452, a subunit 
      vaccine comprising an Fc fusion of the respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain (SP/RBD) emulsified in the 
      water-in-oil adjuvant, Montanide™ ISA 720, suggested a good safety and 
      immunogenicity profile in healthy adults. This phase I study was completed and 
      two dosing regimens were further evaluated in this phase II study. METHODS: This 
      phase II randomized, open-labelled, parallel group study was conducted at a 
      single site in The Netherlands with 52 healthy adults (18 - 72 years) receiving 
      AKS-452 subcutaneously at one 90 µg dose (cohort 1, 26 subjects) or two 45 µg 
      doses 28 days apart (cohort 2, 26 subjects). Serum samples were collected at the 
      first dose (day 0) and at days 28, 56, 90, and 180. Safety and immunogenicity 
      endpoints were assessed, along with induction of IgG isotypes, cross-reactive 
      immunity against viral variants, and IFN-γ T cell responses. RESULTS: All AEs 
      were mild/moderate (grades 1 or 2), and no SAEs were attributable to AKS-452. 
      Seroconversion rates reached 100% in both cohorts, although cohort 2 showed 
      greater geometric mean IgG titers that were stable through day 180 and associated 
      with enhanced potencies of SP/RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition and live virus 
      neutralization. AKS-452-induced IgG titers strongly bound mutant SP/RBD from 
      several SARS-CoV-2 variants (including Omicrons) that were predominantly of the 
      favorable IgG1/3 isotype and IFN-γ-producing T cell phenotype. CONCLUSION: These 
      favorable safety and immunogenicity profiles of the candidate vaccine as 
      demonstrated in this phase II study are consistent with those of the phase I 
      study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04681092) and suggest that a total of 90 µg 
      received in 2 doses may offer a greater duration of cross-reactive neutralizing 
      titers than when given in a single dose.

LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2023.02.058 [doi]
AB  - In this work, laboratory- and large-scale methods were tested for purification of 
      a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine candidate, based on recombinant 
      vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV). First step of the purification, the 
      clarification of the rVSVs produced in serum-free cell culture medium, was tested 
      by centrifugation and filtration using different filtration media and pore sizes 
      (0.45 to 30 µm). To reduce the supernatant volume and process time, the clarified 
      sample was concentrated by ultrafiltration either using tangential flow 
      filtration or centrifugal-based filtration units, depending on the process scale. 
      The final purification step at laboratory-scale, was carried out by density 
      gradient ultracentrifugation, the recovery of which was compared with 
      chromatographic purification at large-scale. The virus preparations were analyzed 
      using dynamic light scattering to verify the virus size and transmission electron 
      microscopy for purity and virus morphology. Density gradient ultracentrifugation 
      allowed the recovery of ≥ 80% infectious particles and reduced the contaminant 
      DNA and host cell proteins relatively to standard ultracentrifugation pelleting 
      using a sucrose cushion. At large-scale, weak and strong anion-exchangers were 
      tested and compared. The best columns allowed infectious virus recoveries as high 
      as 77% and eliminated 92% of host cell proteins.

TI  - Clinical application of trio-based whole-exome sequencing in idiopathic 
      generalized epilepsy.
LID - S1059-1311(23)00050-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.seizure.2023.02.011 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs) are a common group of genetic 
      generalized epilepsies with high genetic heterogeneity and complex inheritance. 
      However, the genetic basis is still largely unknown. This study aimed to explore 
      the genetic etiologies in IGEs. METHODS: Trio-based whole-exome sequencing was 
      performed in 60 cases with IGEs. The pathogenicity of candidate genetic variants 
      was evaluated by the criteria of the American College of Medical Genetics and 
      Genomics (ACMG), and the clinical causality was assessed by concordance between 
      the observed phenotype and the reported phenotype. RESULTS: Seven candidate 
      variants were detected in seven unrelated cases with IGE (11.7%, 7/60). According 
      to ACMG, a de novo SLC2A1 (c.376C>T/p.Arg126Cys) variant identified in childhood 
      absence epilepsy was evaluated as pathogenic with clinical concordance. Six 
      variants were assessed to be uncertain significance by ACMG, but then considered 
      causative after evaluation of clinical concordance. These variants included CLCN4 
      hemizygous variant (c.2044G>A/p.Glu682Lys) and IQSEC2 heterozygous variant 
      (c.4315C>T/p.Pro1439Ser) in juvenile absence epilepsy, EFHC1 variant 
      (c.1504C>T/p.Arg502Trp) and CACNA1H (c.589G>T/p.Ala197Ser) both with incomplete 
      penetrance in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and GRIN2A variant 
      (c.2011C>G/p.Gln671Glu) and GABRB1 variant (c.1075G>A/p.Val359Ile) both 
      co-segregated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Among them, GABRB1 was for the 
      first time identified as potential novel causative gene for IGE. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Considering the genetic heterogeneity and complex inheritance of IGEs, a 
      comprehensive evaluation combined the ACMG scoring and assessment of clinical 
      concordance is suggested for the pathogenicity analysis of variants identified in 
      clinical screening. GABRB1 is probably a novel causative gene for IGE, which 
      warrants further studies.

TI  - Changes in the Initiation of Antipsychotics and Trazodone Over Time: A Cohort 
      Study of New Admissions to Nursing Homes in Ontario, Canada.
LID - S1064-7481(23)00157-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jagp.2023.01.022 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether trazodone is being initiated in lieu of 
      antipsychotics following antipsychotic reduction efforts, this study described 
      changes in medication initiation over time. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 
      cohort study of new admissions to nursing homes in Ontario, Canada between April 
      2010 and December 2019 using health administrative data (N = 61,068). The 
      initiation of antipsychotic and trazodone use was compared by year of admission 
      using discrete time survival analysis and stratified by history of dementia. 
      RESULTS: Relative to residents admitted in 2014, antipsychotic initiation 
      significantly decreased in later years (e.g., 2017 admission year hazard odds 
      ratio [HOR(2017)]=0.72 [95% confidence interval (95%CI)=0.62-0.82]) while 
      trazodone initiation modestly increased (e.g., HOR(2017)=1.09 [95%CI=0.98-1.21]). 
      The relative increase in trazodone initiation was larger among residents with 
      dementia (e.g., HOR(2017Dem) =1.22 [95%CI=1.07-1.39]). CONCLUSIONS: Differences 
      in which medications were started following nursing home admission were observed 
      and suggest trazodone may be initiated in lieu of antipsychotics.

TI  - Increasing the Repertoire for Depression Care: Methods and Challenges of a 
      Randomized Controlled Trial of Peer Support for Vulnerable Older Adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low-income White and older adults of color face barriers to depression 
      care. Our purpose is to describe the methods and challenges encountered during 
      the implementation of a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of 
      a peer support depression care intervention for low-income White and older adults 
      of color during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Peer Enhanced Depression Care 
      (Peers) is an 8-week community-based intervention that uses peer mentors who are 
      trained and supervised to provide social support and self-care skills to 
      depressed older adults. The effectiveness of the intervention in reducing 
      depression will be evaluated by following a sample of older adults recruited in 
      the community over a 12-month period. Target enrollment is 160 older adults. We 
      hypothesize that participants randomized to the Peer Enhanced Depression Care 
      intervention will experience greater decrease in depressive symptoms compared to 
      participants randomized to the social interaction control. We provide lessons 
      learned regarding the recruitment of BIPOC and White low-income older adults and 
      peer mentors during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Recruitment challenges 
      occurred in primary care clinics that were unable to accommodate recruitment 
      efforts during the pandemic. This led to focused outreach to community-based 
      organizations serving older adults. Challenges to participant recruitment have 
      included barriers related to stigma, distrust, as well as unfamiliarity with 
      research. Peer mentor recruitment was facilitated by existing 
      government-supported resources. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide knowledge 
      regarding the effectiveness, mechanism, and processes of delivering an informal 
      psychosocial intervention such as peer support to a vulnerable older adult 
      population.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic experience of diagnostic radiographers: A Singapore survey.
LID - S1939-8654(23)00010-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmir.2023.01.010 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic Radiographers (DR) are the frontline responders during 
      the COVID-19 outbreak, providing essential diagnostic imaging services for 
      screening and monitoring of suspected and confirmed patients. Understanding the 
      experience and perceptions of DR towards the COVID-19 outbreak enables 
      radiography leaders to guide changes in the approach to managing response to 
      future health outbreaks. This study aims to document the experiences of DR in 
      Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All DR practising in Singapore 
      institutions were invited to participate in an online survey, disseminated by the 
      Singapore Society of Radiographers (SSR). The survey assessed the attitudes and 
      perceptions of the respondents on the COVID-19 pandemic. The Holmes and Rahe 
      Stress Scale was used to identify the respondents' life events closely related to 
      the pandemic. Data collection took place from 5 July 2020 to 5 September 2020. 
      RESULTS: A total of 123 DR responded to the survey, where 89.4% of the 
      respondents had been involved in the imaging of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 
      patients. Those performing General Radiography had the highest number of cases - 
      300 cases a month. The fear of transmitting COVID-19 to their family presented as 
      the primary stressor (77.2%), followed by the lack of manpower (73.2%). The 
      global themes that emerged from the study were (1) adapting to change and (2) 
      quality of support. CONCLUSION: Radiology departments in Singapore were able to 
      cope with the high demands of the pandemic in terms of the provision of 
      information, supplies, and physical equipment. However, they were less prepared 
      to handle human factors such as mental health and staff morale. The safety and 
      well-being of staff should not be compromised to reduce staff anxiety while 
      performing their duties. Strategies to improve their ability to adapt to changes 
      and provision of quality support are necessary measures in future pandemic 
      situations.

TI  - Medial sesamoid position in moderate to severe hallux valgus: Correlation between 
      three radiographic measurements.
LID - S0949-2658(23)00020-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jos.2023.02.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In hallux valgus surgery, it is essential to accurately assess the 
      position of the sesamoids both pre- and postoperatively. Weight-bearing foot 
      anteroposterior, tangential sesamoid, and semi-weight-bearing computed tomography 
      axial views are radiographic methods used to assess the medial sesamoid position. 
      This study aimed to measure the medial sesamoid position and evaluate the 
      correlation between these three radiographic methods. METHODS: This retrospective 
      study comprised 59 feet from 49 patients who underwent hallux valgus surgery. The 
      mean age of patients was 54.6 (range, 22-70) years. We took preoperative and 
      postoperative measurements using the weight-bearing anteroposterior, tangential 
      sesamoid, and semi-weight-bearing computed tomography axial views to assess the 
      medial sesamoid position. RESULTS: The mean grades of the medial sesamoid 
      position preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively were 2.5 and 0.8, 1.6 and 
      0.4, and 1.3 and 0.3 points based on the anteroposterior, tangential sesamoid, 
      and computed tomography axial views, respectively (P < 0.001). Preoperatively, 
      there was a strong positive correlation between the computed tomography axial and 
      tangential sesamoid views (P < 0.001, r = 0.645) and anteroposterior and computed 
      tomography axial views (P < 0.001, r = 0.468). In contrast, the tangential 
      sesamoid and anteroposterior views showed a weak positive correlation (P = 0.03, 
      r = 0.283). Six months postoperatively, there was a positive correlation between 
      the computed tomography axial and tangential sesamoid views (P < 0.001, 
      r = 0.473), anteroposterior and computed tomography axial views (P < 0.001, 
      r = 0.470), and tangential sesamoid and anteroposterior views (P < 0.001, 
      r = 0.480). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that the anteroposterior view exhibited a 
      higher degree of medial sesamoid position displacement than the computed 
      tomography axial and tangential sesamoid views. For the preoperative evaluation 
      of the medial sesamoid position, the correlation between the computed tomography 
      axial and tangential sesamoid views was stronger than that between the tangential 
      sesamoid and anteroposterior views. However, all three views showed strong 
      correlations postoperatively.

AB  - The use of standard transactions in the electronic sharing of 
      prescription-related information among payers, prescribers and pharmacists aids 
      in the delivery of effective, safe, and affordable medication therapy to 
      patients. Integral to electronic medication management (eMM) in this environment 
      is the availability of data to aid in the determination of the most appropriate 
      medication for a patient considering benefits coverage restrictions, therapeutic 
      effectiveness, and cost. Key elements of this formulary decision support are the 
      National Council for Prescription Drug Programs Formulary & Benefit (F&B) 
      standard and the related Real-time Pharmacy Benefit (RTPB) standard. In this 
      article, we review the foundational role of F&B in the electronic prescribing of 
      medications, the value it delivers to prescribers, and dispensing pharmacists. 
      The combination of F&B and RTPB to enhance the quality of information available 
      in eMM is also discussed with evidence presented on how these standards help to 
      minimize manual tasks and rework in the pharmacy, optimize time to therapy, lower 
      patient out-of-pocket costs, and result in the dispensing of prescriptions less 
      likely to be abandoned. We conclude with a view of the future of F&B to support 
      new eMM requirements.

AB  - Sex cord tumor with annular tubules (SCTAT) is a rare ovarian tumor. It belongs 
      to sex cord and stromal tumor of the ovary and represents less than 1% of cases. 
      It includes two forms: the first one associated with Peuz-Jeghers syndrome and 
      the second sporadic. We report 4 cases of SCTAT collected at the department of 
      pathology of Salah Azaiez Institute of Tunis over the 12 last years. The age 
      ranged from 10 to 32 years. Symptoms were non specific except for one case 
      revealed by precocious puberty. One patient had Peutz-Jeghers syndrome 
      associated. Tumors were unilateral. Gross findings showed often a solid tumor 
      with yellow cut surface. Their size ranged from 0.5cm to 28cm. Their 
      morphological features were characteristic. Immunohistochemistry showed that 
      tumor cells expressed inhibin and claretinin. The treatment was surgical, often 
      conservative. The diagnosis of malignancy wasn't focused on histological 
      features, but on tumor extension, clinical course, and presence of metastases. 
      Evolution was often favorable. We also performed a systematic review of the 
      literature that identified 166 cases. Features of these cases were studied. We 
      also compared these features between sporadic and syndromic forms and between 
      benign and malignant forms. In conclusion, SCTAT is a rare tumor, usually benign. 
      Its diagnosis is based on histological examination. There is a malignant 
      potential especially in sporadic forms, estimated at 20%. Treatment is most often 
      conservative, based on oophorectomy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) versus open 
      hepatectomy (OH) on the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with 
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) through a meta-analysis of studies using 
      propensity score-matched cohorts. METHODS: The literature search was conducted in 
      PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases until August 31, 2022. 
      Meta-analysis of surgical (major morbidity, the length of hospital stay, 90-day 
      postoperative mortality), oncological (R0 resection rate, lymph node dissection 
      rate) and survival outcomes (1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival and disease-free 
      survival) was performed using a random effects model. Data were summarized as 
      relative risks (RR), mean difference (MD) and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Six case-matched studies with 1054 
      patients were included (LH 518; OH 536). Major morbidity was significantly lower 
      (RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.37-0.88, P = 0.01) and the length of hospital stay was 
      significantly shorter (MD = -2.44, 95% CI = -4.19 to -0.69, P = 0.006) in the LH 
      group than in the OH group, but there was no significant difference in 90-day 
      postoperative mortality between the 2 groups. There were no significant 
      differences in R0 resection rate, lymph node dissection rate, 1-, 3-, and 5-year 
      overall survival or disease-free survival between the LH and OH groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: LH has better surgical outcomes and comparable oncological outcomes 
      and survival outcomes than does OH on ICC. Therefore, laparoscopy is at least not 
      inferior to open surgery for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

TI  - Evaluation of the association between health insurance status and Healthcare 
      utilization and expenditures among adult cancer survivors in the United States.

LID - 10.1016/j.sapharm.2023.02.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care expenditures for cancer care has increased significantly 
      over the past decade and is further projected to rise. This study examined the 
      associations between health insurance status and total direct health care 
      expenditures and health care utilization among cancer survivors living in the 
      United States. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of cancer survivors aged ≥18 
      years, identified from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) during 2017 
      using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes specific for 
      cancer. Health insurance was categorized into Private, Medicare, Medicaid, and 
      uninsured. Multivariable ordinary least squares regression was used to examine 
      the association between log expenditures and health insurance. Negative binomial 
      regression with log link was used to obtain adjusted incident rate ratios (AIRR) 
      for health care utilization. Survey weights were used to produce nationally 
      representative estimates of the US population. RESULTS: A total of 1140 
      (weighted = 13.9 million) cancer survivors were identified. Compared to the 
      adjusted mean annual health care expenditures for the private group ($14,265; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI): $12,645 to $16,092), the adjusted mean annual health 
      care expenditures for the Medicare group were higher ($15,112; 95%CI: $13,361 to 
      $17,092). As compared to the private group, the average annual expenditures for 
      uninsured cancer survivors ($2315; 95%CI:1038 to $3501) was significantly lower 
      and so was their health care utilization. Adjusted rates of ER visits for 
      Medicaid were twice (AIRR:2.04; SE:0.28; p = 0.001) as compared to privately 
      insured. CONCLUSIONS: A difference in the average total direct expenditures 
      between uninsured and privately insured patients was found. Uninsured had the 
      lowest health care utilization while Medicaid reported significantly higher 
      number of ER visits. Despite differences in program structures, health care 
      expenditures across insurance types were similar. Lower utilization of health 
      care services among uninsured suggests cost maybe a barrier to accessing care.

AB  - Bezoars consist of ingested foreign material or organic matter which forms a mass 
      in the gastrointestinal tract, usually in the stomach. Trichobezoars formed by 
      swallowed hair may present with vomiting, malnutrition, weight loss or abdominal 
      pain with signs of gastrointestinal obstruction. There are limited case reports 
      of Trichobezoar during pregnancy. We present a case of young pregnant women who 
      was admitted on few occasions with vomiting in early pregnancy and was treated as 
      hyperemesis gravidarum. Failure of response to conventional management prompted 
      further investigation, revealing trichobezoar. Our case highlights the diagnostic 
      challenge posed by trichobezoars in young pregnant women.

AB  - Herein we focus on connections between genetics and some central disorders of 
      hypersomnolence - narcolepsy types 1 and 2 (NT1, NT2), idiopathic hypersomnia 
      (IH), and Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) - for a better understanding of their 
      etiopathogenetic mechanisms and a better diagnostic and therapeutic definition. 
      Gene pleiotropism influences neurological and sleep disorders such as 
      hypersomnia; therefore, genetics allows us to uncover common pathways to 
      different pathologies, with potential new therapeutic perspectives. An important 
      body of evidence has accumulated on NT1 and IH, allowing a better understanding 
      of etiopathogenesis, disease biomarkers, and possible new therapeutic approaches. 
      Further studies are needed in the field of epigenetics, which has a potential 
      role in the modulation of biological specific hypersomnia pathways.

AB  - Clonal selection and drift drive both normal tissue and cancer development. 
      However, the biological mechanisms and environmental conditions underpinning 
      these processes remain to be elucidated. Clonal selection models are centered in 
      Darwinian evolutionary theory, where some clones with the fittest features are 
      selected and populate the tissue or tumor. We suggest that different subclasses 
      of stem cells, each of which is responsible for a distinct feature of the 
      selection process, share common features between normal and cancer conditions. 
      While active stem cells populate the tissue, dormant cells account for tissue 
      replenishment/regeneration in both normal and cancerous tissues. We also discuss 
      potential mechanisms that drive clonal drift, their interactions with clonal 
      selection, and their similarities during normal and cancer tissue development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Currently available cytotoxic treatments have limited effect on 
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) because desmoplastic stroma limits drug 
      delivery. Efforts have been made to overcome these barriers by drug targeting the 
      tumor microenvironment. Results so far are promising, but without clinical 
      impact. Our aim was to investigate whether ultrasound and microbubbles could 
      improve the uptake and therapeutic response of conventional chemotherapy. 
      METHODS: Orthotopic pancreatic tumors growing in mice were treated with 
      commercially available FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and 
      calcium folinate) and SonoVue microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound. 
      Tumor uptake of platinum (Pt) was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass 
      spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and tumor volumes were measured by ultrasound imaging. 
      DISCUSSION: Uptake of Pt, the active ingredient of oxaliplatin, was significantly 
      increased after ultrasound treatment of orthotopic PDAC tumors. Multiple 
      injections with FOLFIRONOX increased the amount of Pt in tumors. However, the 
      enhanced accumulation did not improve therapeutic response. Increased uptake of 
      Pt confirms that ultrasound and microbubbles have potential in clinical practice 
      with existing drugs. CONCLUSION: The lack of therapeutic response, despite 
      increased uptake in tumor tissue, emphasizes the importance of studying how to 
      overcome stromal barriers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Modelling ultrasound speckle to characterise tissue properties has 
      generated considerable interest. As speckle is dependent on the underlying tissue 
      architecture, modelling it may aid in tasks such as segmentation or disease 
      detection. For the transplanted kidney, where ultrasound is used to investigate 
      dysfunction, it is unknown which statistical distribution best characterises such 
      speckle. This applies to the regions of the transplanted kidney: the cortex, the 
      medulla and the central echogenic complex. Furthermore, it is unclear how these 
      distributions vary by patient variables such as age, sex, body mass index, 
      primary disease or donor type. These traits may influence speckle modelling given 
      their influence on kidney anatomy. We investigate these two aims. METHODS: B-mode 
      images from n = 821 kidney transplant recipients (one image per recipient) were 
      automatically segmented into the cortex, medulla and central echogenic complex 
      using a neural network. Seven distinct probability distributions were fitted to 
      each region's histogram, and statistical analysis was performed. DISCUSSION: The 
      Rayleigh and Nakagami distributions had model parameters that differed 
      significantly between the three regions (p ≤ 0.05). Although both had excellent 
      goodness of fit, the Nakagami had higher Kullbeck-Leibler divergence. Recipient 
      age correlated weakly with scale in the cortex (Ω: ρ = 0.11, p = 0.004), while 
      body mass index correlated weakly with shape in the medulla (m: ρ = 0.08, 
      p = 0.04). Neither sex, primary disease nor donor type exhibited any correlation. 
      CONCLUSION: We propose the Nakagami distribution be used to characterize 
      transplanted kidneys regionally independent of disease etiology and most patient 
      characteristics.

LID - 10.1016/j.pedneo.2022.11.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since a high incidence of mortality and morbidity is induced by 
      preterm birth, it is important to understand how hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy 
      (HIE) in preterm infants alters gut microbiota development. METHODS: We analyzed 
      89 stools from 30 term newborns (NNG), 30 preterm infants without apnea (PG) and 
      29 preterm infants with definite diagnosis of apnea (PAG) by 16S rRNA gene 
      sequencing in this study. RESULTS: The data showed that species richness and 
      diversity in PG and PAG were significantly lower compared with NNG. This study 
      investigated the difference in bacteria and relative abundance between NNG, PG 
      and PAG. The abundance of Klebsiella and Streptococcus strains were markedly 
      increased, while Clostridium was significantly decreased in PAG compared with PG. 
      The most notable exceptions included Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, 
      which were markedly increased in PG and PAG, and these provide the main bacterial 
      source of dopamine and serotonin production. This study also revealed that 
      Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were markedly increased in PG and PAG, and 
      these are the main source of GABA production for bacteria. CONCLUSION: The 
      present study confirmed that apnea had a uniform effect on species richness and 
      diversity. However, it cannot be established whether the abundance and difference 
      of these bacterial genera and species directly affect the occurrence and 
      development of preterm infants with HIE by secreting intestinal 
      neurotransmitters.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The role of Aeromonas species in gastrointestinal disease is 
      controversial. The aim was to analyze not only the virulence genes between 
      different species of Aeromonas isolated from feces, but the distribution of these 
      virulence genes between enterotoxigenic strains and co-pathogen strains. METHODS: 
      Retrospective study of isolates of Aeromonas spp. in feces (2016-2021). The 
      protocol included coproculture, identification by MALDI-TOF and confirmation by 
      multiplex PCR. SPSS Statistics program was used. RESULTS: A total of 288 strains 
      were studied for the virulence genes between different species of Aeromonas. To 
      compare virulence genes between Aeromonas as co-pathogen and those isolated 
      alone, 218 strains of the global set were used; 52 as co-pathogens compared with 
      166 Aeromonas without associated pathogen as controls. CONCLUSIONS: We found no 
      significant differences in the distribution of virulence genes versus 
      co-existence of co-pathogens or not. A. hydrophila is the potentially most 
      virulent species of our set.

LID - 10.1016/j.surg.2023.01.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of upward economic mobility and race/ethnicity on 
      achieving quality metrics such as textbook outcomes remains ill-defined. As such, 
      we sought to define the impact of race and county-level upward economic mobility 
      on the ability to achieve a textbook outcome among patients undergoing hepatic 
      and pancreatic surgery. METHODS: Patients who underwent hepatic or pancreatic 
      procedures between 2013 and 2017 were identified from the Medicare Standard 
      Analytic Files. The primary outcomes of interest were textbook outcome and its 
      components. RESULTS: Among 35,403 patients, 17,923 (50.6%) patients were 
      classified as living in a low upward economic mobility county, whereas 17,480 
      (49.4%) lived in a high upward economic mobility county. Furthermore, 32,981 
      (93.1%) patients were White, and 2,422 (6.8%) were Black. Overall, a textbook 
      outcome was achieved in 45.6% of patients (n = 16,139), with textbook outcome 
      most likely in patients from a high upward economic mobility county compared with 
      a low upward economic mobility county (low: 44.6% vs high: 46.6%, P < .001). On 
      multivariable analysis, patients in a low upward economic mobility county had 6% 
      lower odds of achieving a textbook outcome compared with a high upward economic 
      mobility county (odds ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.90-0.98). 
      Furthermore, Black patients were less likely to achieve a textbook outcome (odds 
      ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.84-0.99) and had 17% and 15% higher odds of 
      developing a complication (odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.28) 
      and extended length of stay (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.27), 
      respectively. Within races, White patients in a high upward economic mobility 
      county had 7% higher odds of achieving a textbook outcome compared with White 
      patients in a low upward economic mobility county (odds ratio 1.07, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.02-1.12), although no such effect was observed in Black 
      patients (odds ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.77-1.15). Furthermore, Black 
      patients in a high upward economic mobility county had similar odds of achieving 
      a textbook outcome compared with White patients in a low upward economic mobility 
      county (odds ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.77-1.09). CONCLUSION: These 
      results highlight the differential impact of upward economic mobility and race on 
      postoperative outcomes. Due to the health care implications of socioeconomic 
      status, future policy initiatives should target economic mobility as a means to 
      ensure greater health care equity.

      surgical programs wherein 1 surgical team performs 2 pancreatoduodenectomies on a 
      single day. It is unclear whether this practice has a negative impact on surgical 
      outcome. METHODS: We conuducted a retrospective analysis including all 
      consecutive open pancreatoduodenectomies in a single high-volume center 
      (2014-2021). Pancreatoduodenectomies were grouped as the first 
      (pancreatoduodenectomy-1) or second (pancreatoduodenectomy-2) 
      pancreatoduodenectomy on a single day (ie, paired pancreatoduodenectomies) and as 
      pancreatoduodenectomy-3 whenever 1 pancreatoduodenectomy was performed per day 
      (ie, unpaired). Patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures were excluded. 
      The primary outcomes were major morbidity (ie, Clavien-Dindo grade ≥IIIa) and 
      mortality. RESULTS: Among 689 patients, 151 patients had undergone minimally 
      invasive pancreatoduodenectomy, leaving 538 patients after open 
      pancreatoduodenectomy for inclusion. The overall rate of major morbidity was 
      37.4% (n = 200/538) and in-hospital/30-day mortality 1.7% (n = 9/538). Overall, 
      136 (25.3%) patients were operated in 68 pancreatoduodenectomy-1/ 
      pancreatoduodenectomy-2 pairs and 402 (74.7%) patients as unpaired 
      pancreatoduodenectomy (pancreatoduodenectomy-3). No differences were found 
      between pancreatoduodenectomy-1 and pancreatoduodenectomy-2 regarding the rates 
      of major morbidity (35.3% vs 26.5%; P = .265) and mortality (1.5% vs 0%; P = 
      .999). Between the 68 pancreatoduodenectomy-1/ pancreatoduodenectomy-2 pairs and 
      the 402 unpaired pancreatoduodenectomies, the rates of major morbidity (30.9% vs 
      39.6%; P = .071) and mortality (0.7% vs 2.0%; P = .461) did not differ 
      significantly. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, 
      pancreatoduodenectomy-1 was not associated with major morbidity (odds ratio = 
      0.913 [95% confidence interval 0.515-1.620]; P = .756), whereas 
      pancreatoduodenectomy-2 was associated with less major morbidity (odds ratio = 
      0.522 [95% confidence interval 0.277-0.983]; P = .045). CONCLUSION: In a 
      high-volume setting, performing 2 consecutive open pancreatoduodenectomies on a 
      single operating day appears to be safe. This approach may be an option when 
      logistically required.

TI  - Impact of caudal block on revision rates after hypospadias repair: 
      Multi-institution review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is controversy surrounding the association between caudal 
      block and complication rates after hypospadias repair. Conflicting results have 
      been reported mostly from single-center, low volume studies and those that did 
      not include relevant variables. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that caudal block is 
      not associated with increased rates of reoperation after primary repair and is 
      associated with more complex hypospadias surgery. STUDY DESIGN: The Clinical 
      Practice Solutions Center database was queried to identify patients who received 
      a primary hypospadias repair between 2009 and 2010. Primary hypospadias repair 
      was further categorized as meatal advancement and glanduloplasty, distal, 
      one-stage proximal, or one-stage perineal repair. Anesthesia coding was evaluated 
      to identify those who received a caudal block. Any revision surgery was captured 
      between 2009 and 2019 and the types of revision surgeries were identified. 
      Variables such as caudal block, age, insurance type, surgeon volume, and surgeon 
      years in practice were analyzed with mixed effects multiple logistic regression 
      models. RESULTS: The dataset query identified 3343 pediatric males who had 
      primary hypospadias repair. The procedures were performed by 50 surgeons at 27 
      hospitals. Primary surgeries included meatal advancement and glanduloplasty 
      (23%), distal (69%), proximal (6.9%), and perineal repairs (1%). Caudal block was 
      administered to 42% of patients. Utilization of caudal block was not associated 
      with type of primary surgery (p = 0.21). Adjusting for all other variables, 
      increased patient age was associated with decreased usage of caudal block 
      (p < 0.001). Analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant association 
      between utilization of caudal block with rates of revision surgery. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This large, multi-institution study demonstrates that the use of caudal block was 
      not associated with more complex hypospadias surgery nor statistically 
      significantly associated with increased rates of revision surgery after primary 
      hypospadias repair.

TI  - Dosimetric assessment of the mono and dual-isocentric VMAT technique based on 
      flattening filter-free beams for SBRT with non-contiguous spinal targets.
LID - S0958-3947(23)00014-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.meddos.2023.01.005 [doi]
AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the planning characteristics of spinal stereotactic 
      body radiotherapy (SBRT) using mono- and dual-isocentric volumetrically modulated 
      arc therapy (VMAT) techniques. The dosimetric indices were compared between 
      different beam arrangement techniques for spinal SBRT planning, including spinal 
      cord avoidance, planning target volume (PTV) dose coverage, conformity, 
      homogeneity, and gradient index. A total of 8 PTVs were contoured on RANDO 
      phantom computed tomography (CT) images, with 4 PTVs per section of the spine 
      (thoracic and lumbar). VMAT plans for each PTV were generated using 4 different 
      beam arrangement techniques with a 6-MV FFF photon beam, two of which were 
      mono-isocentric (MI) and 2 of which were dual-isocentric (DI). Dose calculations 
      for all plans were performed using the Acuros XB algorithm. The study found that 
      when non-contiguous spinal lesions are widely spaced, it may be more effective to 
      use 4-Arcs DI to generate a better homogeneity index and gradient index, whereas 
      2-Arcs MI was beneficial for closely spaced lesions. Furthermore, the use of more 
      arcs with a dual isocenter reduced the volume of partial cord receiving 10 Gy 
      (V(10Gy)), maximum dose to 0.03 cc of partial cord (D(0.03cc)), and monitor units 
      (MUs). The results showed that DI has a higher plan quality than MI for treating 
      non-contiguous spine SBRT, with better homogeneity and a lower dose to the spinal 
      cord, as well as comparable tumor coverage, delivery accuracy, and adequate 
      tumour coverage. 4-Arcs DI had the sharpest dose falloff and achieved the lowest 
      overall spinal cord doses at the expense of twice the treatment time as 2Arcs-MI. 
      These results could help figure out which VMAT beam arrangements are best for 
      treating non-contiguous spinal tumors.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate percutaneous ultrasound-guided day-case mucin aspiration in 
      advanced pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) using a wide-bore drain with regards to its 
      safety and efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who underwent 
      percutaneous mucin aspiration for PMP between 2019-2021 at a single national 
      peritoneal tumour service were included in this study. Under local anaesthesia, a 
      suction-enabled 28-32 F catheter was used for drainage following wire-guided 
      track dilatation. The volume drained and difference in abdominal girth pre- and 
      post-procedure were measured. Patients graded difficulty in breathing and 
      abdominal discomfort pre- and post-procedure. Histology reports were reviewed. 
      RESULTS: Sixteen patients received 56 percutaneous mucin aspirations between 
      2019-2021. The aetiology was a low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) in 
      50% of patients. The mean amount of mucin drained was 7,320 ± 3,000ml (range 
      300-13,500 ml). The mean reduction in abdominal girth post-procedure was 12.2 ± 5 
      cm (range 0-27 cm). Only grade 1 complications were observed. CONCLUSION: 
      Percutaneous ultrasound-guided day-case aspiration of mucin for advanced and 
      recurrent PMP using a wide-bore drain is a safe and effective procedure. It may 
      be used in the palliative setting or as a bridge to surgery in the very 
      symptomatic patient or if there is a reversible contraindication to surgery.

LID - 10.1016/j.clgc.2023.01.003 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
      (nmCRPC), prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) is associated with risk 
      of metastasis and survival. This study evaluated the association of PSADT with 
      clinical and economic outcomes in a real-world setting among patients with nmCRPC 
      not receiving novel hormonal therapy (NHT), using 2-month PSADT thresholds. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified Veterans Health 
      Administration patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer and ≥2 PSA increases 
      after medical/surgical castration (2012-2016). The third measurement was the 
      index (CRPC) date. Patients with ≥3 postindex PSA measurements, including index, 
      were followed until death or ≥12 months until disenrollment, study end, or death, 
      and grouped into 2-month cohorts based on postindex PSADT. Cox regression models 
      assessed association between PSADT, time to metastasis, and death. Healthcare 
      resource utilization and costs were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 2800 evaluable 
      patients, median follow-up was 30 months and median PSADT was 17 months. Relative 
      to the reference cohort (PSADT >12 months), all cohorts had significantly higher 
      metastasis risk. PSADT ≤10-month cohorts had significantly greater mortality risk 
      than the reference; hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) ranged from 12.3 
      (9.2, 16.4) in the PSADT ≤2-month cohort to 1.3 (0.9, 2.0) in the >10 to 
      ≤12-month cohort. Total costs were significantly higher for cohorts up to and 
      including the PSADT >8 to ≤10-month cohort, than for the reference cohort. Mean 
      per patient per month all-cause medical plus pharmacy costs were $6623, $4768, 
      and $4049 in the PSADT ≤2-month, >2 to ≤4-month cohort, and >4 to ≤6-month 
      cohorts, respectively, versus $1911 in the PSADT >12-month cohort (P <0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Most patients with nmCRPC have PSADT >12 months and a long natural 
      history. For those with shorter PSADT, the risk of metastasis, death, and costs 
      increased. These data can help select patients for NHT and conversely those who 
      can safely delay NHT for nmCRPC.

AB  - The activation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) is controlled by various 
      tissue-derived factors, including cytokines, whereas T cells respond to foreign 
      antigens. This review discusses the tissue-specific properties of ILC2s in skin 
      and their involvement in human skin diseases. In a steady state, cutaneous ILC2s 
      contribute to tissue homeostasis. In the keratinocytes of patients with atopic 
      dermatitis (AD), the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is 
      overexpressed. ILC2s are stimulated by IL-33-stimulated basophils through IL-4 to 
      produce type 2 cytokines, such as IL-5 and IL-13. According to several studies, 
      ILC2 expression is upregulated in human AD skin lesions, and it is involved in AD 
      pathogenesis. Dupilumab, an antibody against IL-4 receptor α, lowered the number 
      and percentage of ILC2s in the peripheral blood of patients with AD. Cutaneous 
      ILC2s are divided into two subgroups: circulating and skin-resident ILC2s. 
      However, ILC2s are homogeneous cell populations that are highly diverse and 
      plastic, and there is no consensus on the classification that should be used. The 
      variations in the definition for cutaneous ILC2s in different studies make 
      comparisons among studies difficult, and in particular, the weak expression of 
      the IL-33 receptor ST2 in cutaneous ILC2s and its lack of markers have posed a 
      great challenge to researchers. Therefore, further comprehensive analytical 
      studies are warranted.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases continue to pose a significant burden on global 
      public health, and there is a critical need to better understand transmission 
      dynamics arising at the interface of human activity and wildlife habitats. 
      Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), more typically applied to questions of 
      biodiversity and conservation, provides an opportunity to collect and analyse 
      audio data in relative real time and at low cost. Acoustic methods are 
      increasingly accessible, with the expansion of cloud-based computing, low-cost 
      hardware, and machine learning approaches. Paired with purposeful experimental 
      design, acoustic data can complement existing surveillance methods and provide a 
      novel toolkit to investigate the key biological parameters and ecological 
      interactions that underpin infectious disease epidemiology.

AB  - In Part 1, we provided a general description of macromolecules, pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) characteristics in non-pregnant subjects, and the physiological changes 
      during pregnancy. Here we further elaborate on the impact of pregnancy on the PK 
      of antibodies through illustrative case studies (immunoglobulins, infliximab, 
      adalimumab and eculizumab). Using published data from nonclinical and clinical 
      studies, we present measured or calculated PK parameters from pregnant subjects 
      comparing with data from non-pregnant subjects, if available. Due to the paucity 
      of PK data evaluating PK of antibodies during pregnancy, we also provide examples 
      of PK studies for small molecules. Finally, we draw conclusions on the nature and 
      direction of PK changes for both antibodies and small molecules as well as 
      provide recommendations for areas that would benefit from further studies.

TI  - Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography as a Biomarker to 
      Assess Treatment Response in Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer.
LID - S2405-4569(23)00040-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.euf.2023.02.001 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted positron emission 
      tomography (PET) has superior accuracy for detection of metastatic lesions in 
      patients with prostate cancer (PC). Although PSMA PET has a prominent role in 
      primary and secondary imaging of PC, data on its role in assessing treatment 
      response in advanced PC are limited. OBJECTIVE: To review current data in the 
      literature regarding the impact of antiandrogen therapy on PSMA expression of 
      metastatic sites and the role of serial (baseline and at least 1 follow-up scan) 
      PSMA PET to assess treatment response in patients with metastatic PC. EVIDENCE 
      ACQUISITION: A comprehensive literature search in the PubMed database was 
      performed using the terms "PSMA expression prostate", "PSMA regulation", "PSMA 
      PET response assessment", and "serial PSMA PET". EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Serial PSMA 
      PET studies (baseline and at least 1 follow-up scan) provide valuable data 
      regarding PSMA expression changes after systemic treatment in patients with 
      metastatic PC. PSMA PET-detected flare and upregulation of PSMA expression 
      following hormonal intervention seem to be early events resolving after 3 mo of 
      treatment. PSMA PET imaging is essential in selecting patients for (177)Lu-PSMA 
      radioligand therapy (RLT). Growing evidence favors its use in assessing treatment 
      responses after RLT. Preliminary evidence indicates the value of PSMA PET for 
      assessment of the treatment response in patients receiving systemic treatment 
      other than RLT for metastatic PC. CONCLUSIONS: PSMA flare following antiandrogen 
      therapy seems to be an early event and thus PET scans should be performed no 
      earlier than 3 mo after the start of treatment. PSMA PET has a promising role in 
      tailoring treatment according to the specific needs of individual patients and 
      assessing responses following systemic treatment in patients with advanced PC. 
      PATIENT SUMMARY: This review describes how a sensitive imaging method can be used 
      to assess the tumor response to treatment for metastatic prostate cancer.

AB  - Cancer survivorship is particularly significant for patients with urologic 
      malignancies, who account for >25% of cancer survivors. The American Cancer 
      Society has a guideline on survivorship care in prostate cancer and the American 
      Urological Association has published a core curriculum on cancer survivorship in 
      urologic cancers. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence on 
      survivorship strategies to inform guideline recommendations. Future efforts need 
      to focus on producing high-quality survivorship research and on increasing 
      appropriate resources to improve the implementation of survivorship care. PATIENT 
      SUMMARY: There are few guidelines on survivorship care for patients with 
      prostate, bladder, penile, or kidney cancer. More funding is needed for research 
      into care for cancer survivors.

TI  - Saline bladder infusion vs standard catheter removal in patients with acute 
      urinary retention related to benign prostatic hyperplasia: The BLAPERF Study.
LID - S1166-7087(23)00044-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.purol.2023.02.002 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Bladder infusion, which involves filling the bladder with saline prior 
      to catheter removal, has been associated with reduced time-to-discharge and 
      increased success rates in trials without catheter (TWOCs) in perioperative 
      setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of this 
      protocol in patients with acute urinary retention (AUR) related to benign 
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center 
      study comparing bladder infusion with at least 150mL of warm saline vs. standard 
      catheter removal during TWOC in patients with BPH-related AUR between January and 
      December 2021. The primary outcome was time to discharge. Secondary outcomes 
      included: TWOC success, and early recurrence of urinary retention defined as 
      recurrence within three months of successful TWOC. RESULTS: A total of 75 men 
      were included: 35 in the bladder infusion protocol and 40 in the standard 
      protocol. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. Overall, 
      35 patients (46.7%) had a successful TWOC without statistically significant 
      difference between groups (P=0.10). Bladder infusion protocol was associated with 
      a shorter median time to discharge (200 vs. 240min, P=0.003). However, patients 
      in the bladder infusion group were associated with a higher risk of early 
      recurrence of urinary retention (30% vs. 0%, P=0.02). CONCLUSION: In patients 
      with BPH-related AUR, the saline bladder infusion method reduced 
      time-to-discharge with similar TWOC success rates. Larger studies are needed to 
      properly analyze the risk of early recurrence of urinary retention before any 
      clinical application. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical correction of hammertoe deformities with arthrodesis of the 
      proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) is one of the most frequent forefoot 
      procedures. Recently, new intramedullary fixation devices for PIP arthrodesis 
      have been introduced. The aim of this study was to compare a newly developed 
      absorbable intramedullary implant made of magnesium (mm.PIP), an already 
      available intramedullary implant made of titanium (PipTree), and the classical 
      Kirschner-wire (K-wire). METHODS: The three intramedullary devices (mm.PIP, 
      PipTree, and K-wire) for PIP arthrodesis were compared. A classical arthrodesis 
      of the PIP joint was performed on fifty-four composite synthetic bone pairs. 
      After arthrodesis, torsional load, weight-bearing and cyclic load tests were 
      performed, and stability of the synthetic bone pairs was analyzed. Statistischer 
      Vergleich - wie? RESULTS: The mm.PIP was the most torsion resistant (mm.PIP vs. 
      PipTree and K-wire, p < 0.001). The PipTree showed the best overall stability 
      during cyclic weight-bearing simulation (PipTree vs. mm.PIP and K-wire, 
      p < 0.001). K-wire demonstrated the highest breaking loads during bending tests 
      (K-wire vs. mm-PIP and PipTree, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Biomechanical properties 
      of two new intramedullar implants, the bioresorbable mm.PIP made of magnesium and 
      the PipTree made of titanium, were found to be comparable to the biomechanical 
      properties of a K-wire which is commonly used for this procedure. Future work 
      should be directed towards a clinical assessment of the bioabsorbable fixation 
      devices for hammertoe procedures.

TI  - Examining the diversity of MRCS examiners.
LID - S1479-666X(23)00021-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.surge.2023.02.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MRCS examiners are the face of the Royal College of Surgeons for 
      early-career surgeons and should therefore represent the workforce they are 
      examining as not to marginalise or negatively impact on the assessment experience 
      of candidates from minoritised groups. This study aimed to explore the diversity 
      of MRCS examiners and whether they represent the demographics of the MRCS 
      candidates. METHODS: A retrospective observational study including all active 
      examiners and examination candidates who attempted MRCS Part A or Part B between 
      January 2020 and July 2021. Self-declared demographic data collected by the 
      Intercollegiate Committee for Basic Surgical Examinations (ICBSE) included 
      gender, sexual orientation, disability status and ethnicity. Following data 
      anonymisation, total group response frequencies were made available to the 
      research team for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Chi-squared analyses showed 
      statistically significant differences in the representation of gender, disability 
      and ethnicity between candidates and examiners (all p < 0.001). Men (83.9% 
      (n = 1121) vs 70.9% (n = 6017) respectively), individuals without disability 
      (98.7% (n = 917) vs 96.1% (n = 6847)) and individuals of White ethnicity (36.6% 
      (n = 346) vs 20.4% (n = 1223)) were significantly overrepresented in the 
      examiners compared to the examination candidates. There was no statistically 
      significant difference in sexual orientation between examiners and candidates 
      (p = 0.712). CONCLUSIONS: Broadly speaking, the socio-demographic profile of MRCS 
      examiners reflects that seen in senior and leadership positions in surgery in the 
      UK - that is, predominantly male and White - but not that seen in early-career 
      surgeons. Positive action is now required in examiner recruitment by the Royal 
      Colleges to ensure that the cohort of MRCS examiners reflects the modern surgical 
      workforce.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Negative psychological sequelae have been reported after bariatric 
      surgery. It is unclear which factors affect psychological function in the first 
      postoperative years. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of significant predictors of improved 
      psychological function following bariatric surgery by analyzing data from the 
      BODY-Q questionnaire. SETTING: Multicenter prospective cohort in 3 centers 
      located in The Netherlands and Denmark. METHODS: The BODY-Q questionnaire was 
      used to assess 6 domains of health-related quality of life. The domain of 
      interest, psychological function, consists of 10 questions from which a converted 
      score of 0 (low) to 100 (high) can be calculated. Linear mixed models were used 
      to analyze which patient characteristics were most predictive of the 
      psychological function score. Secondary outcomes of interest were cross-sectional 
      scores of psychological function and the impact of weight loss, and the effect of 
      major short-term complications on psychological function. RESULTS: Data were 
      analyzed from 836 patients who underwent bariatric surgery from 2015 to 2020. 
      Patients with lower expectations concerning weight loss (<40% desired total 
      weight loss), higher educational level, no history of psychiatric illness, and 
      employment before bariatric surgery demonstrated the highest psychological 
      function scores after bariatric surgery. At 1 and 2 years after bariatric 
      surgery, more weight loss was associated with significantly higher psychological 
      function scores. Experiencing a major short-term complication did not 
      significantly impact psychological function. CONCLUSIONS: Several relevant 
      predictors of improved postoperative psychological function have been identified. 
      This knowledge can be used to enhance patient education preoperatively and 
      identify patients at risk for poor psychological functioning postoperatively.

TI  - Plasma short-chain fatty acid changes after bariatric surgery in patients with 
      severe obesity.
LID - S1550-7289(23)00041-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.soard.2022.12.041 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity has reached epidemic dimensions in recent decades. Bariatric 
      surgery (BS) is one of the most effective interventions for weight loss and 
      metabolic improvement in patients with obesity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) 
      are gut microbiota-derived metabolites with a key role in body weight control and 
      insulin sensitivity. Although BS is known to induce significant changes in the 
      gut microbiota composition, its impact on the circulating levels of certain 
      metabolites produced by the gut microbiota such as SCFA remains poorly 
      understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of BS on the circulating SCFA 
      levels in patients with severe obesity. SETTING: University hospital. METHODS: An 
      observational, prospective study was performed on 51 patients undergoing 
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Plasma samples were collected at baseline (1 day before 
      surgery) and at 6 and 12 months after BS. Plasma SCFA levels were determined by 
      liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The results revealed 
      significant changes in the circulating levels of SCFA after BS. A marked increase 
      in propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate levels and a decrease in 
      acetate, valerate, hexanoate, and heptanoate levels were observed 12 months after 
      BS. Furthermore, the changes in the levels of propionate, butyrate, and 
      isobutyrate negatively correlated with changes in body mass index, while those of 
      isobutyrate correlated negatively with changes in the homeostatic model 
      assessment for insulin resistance index. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 
      propionate, butyrate, and isobutyrate levels could be related to weight loss and 
      improved insulin sensitivity in patients with severe obesity after BS.

      preparation. AIM: To assess the safety and efficacy of OPN balloon in patients 
      with calcified coronary lesions. METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated, 
      prospective, observational study. The primary outcome of the study was a 
      procedural success. RESULTS: We studied 71 patients (133 lesions). Maximum 
      lesions were located in LAD [46.6 %]. The OPN balloon was used for pre-dilatation 
      alone in 28.6 % (Pre-stent OPN group), post-dilatation alone in 63.2 % of lesions 
      (Post-stent OPN group), and in both situations in 8.3 % of lesions with 
      procedural success in 98.5 % of patients. Further dilatation with different NC 
      balloons was required in both groups (30 %). The median (IQR) OPN balloon 
      diameter in the pre- and post-stent OPN group were 2.5 (2.5, 3.0) and 3.0 
      (3.0,3.0) mm (p = 0.001), respectively. The difference between the diameter of 
      the stent and OPN balloon used in pre-stent OPN group was 0.5 (0.2, 0.5) mm while 
      it was 0.0 (0.0,0.2) mm in the post-stent OPN group (p < 0.001). Eight 
      complications and two deaths occured. Hypotube ruptured was also noted. 
      CONCLUSION: OPN balloon is safe, and effective in treating calcified coronary 
      lesions. We propose to undersize the balloon by 0.5 mm for pre-dilatation 
      followed by 0.25 mm larger NC balloon if needed. In the post-dilatation group, 
      use a 1:1 size balloon in a non-tortuous straight segment. Use imaging especially 
      when (1) the pressure taken more than the rated burst pressure, (2) an OPN 
      balloon size is ≥3 mm (3) using 1:1 size OPN balloon in a tortuous segment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Senegal, marital infertility is a real problem for society. We 
      undertook the study of this subject to make an analysis of the spermatic 
      parameters of the infertile Senegalese man and to better understand the impact of 
      testicular morphological anomalies on male fertility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We 
      conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive, retrospective study of 100 infertile 
      patients followed at the Histology-Embryology-Cytogenetics laboratory of UCAD in 
      Dakar, during the year 2020. Sperm parameters, presence of varicocele, and 
      testicular volume were evaluated in our patients. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: The mean 
      age of the patients was 35.17±8.7 years. A history of sexually transmitted 
      infections was found in 57% of patients. The mean duration of infertility was 
      5.67±3.2 years. The mean sperm count was 14,871,230/ml±4,950,000. Necrospermia 
      was the most frequent abnormality found (60%), followed by asthenospermia (51%). 
      The high rate of necrospermia could be explained by the high frequency of 
      sexually transmitted infections. Other abnormalities were oligospermia (48%, 
      including 09% cryptospermia), azoospermia (19%), teratospermia (19%), and 
      hypospermia (13%). The predominance of azoospermia and oligospermia should prompt 
      a search for a genetic predisposition in these subjects. The mean testicular 
      volume was 10.3±4.9 cc on the right and 9.5±4.8 cc on the left. A single or 
      bilateral varicocele was found in 43% of subjects. Patients with azoospermia and 
      teratospermia were associated with testicular hypotrophy with a significant value 
      (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: Overall, the senegalese man consulting for infertility is a 
      young adult, married for an average of 5 years. Necrospermia is the most 
      frequently found anomaly. The severity of both qualitative and quantitative 
      abnormalities should lead to a systematic search for a genetic origin. The 
      etiological research of infertile patients must be done within a 
      multidisciplinary framework to propose better management of these patients.

TI  - Maternal and Paternal Dietary Quality and Dietary Inflammation Associations with 
      Offspring DNA Methylation and Epigenetic Biomarkers of Aging in the Lifeways 
      Cross-Generation Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early-life nutritional exposures may contribute to offspring 
      epigenetic modifications. However, few studies have evaluated parental dietary 
      quality effects on offspring DNA methylation (DNAm). OBJECTIVES: We aim to fill 
      this gap by elucidating the influence of maternal and paternal whole-diet quality 
      and inflammatory potential on offspring DNAm in the Lifeways Cross-generation 
      cohort. METHODS: Families (n = 1124) were recruited around 16 weeks of gestation 
      in the Republic of Ireland between 2001 and 2003. Maternal dietary intake during 
      the first trimester and paternal diet during the 12 previous months were assessed 
      with an FFQ. Parental dietary inflammatory potential and quality were determined 
      using the energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII), the Healthy Eating 
      Index-2015 (HEI-2015), and the maternal DASH score. DNAm in the saliva of 246 
      children at age nine was measured using the Illumina Infinium 
      HumanMethylationEPIC array. DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging, the 
      Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic clock and DNAm estimator of telomere length, were 
      calculated. Parental diet associations with the DNAm concentrations of 850K 
      Cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpG sites) and with DNAm-derived biomarkers of 
      aging were examined using an epigenome-wide association study and linear 
      regressions, respectively. RESULTS: Maternal HEI-2015 scores were inversely 
      associated with DNAm at CpG site (cg21840035) located near the PLEKHM1 gene, 
      whose functions involve regulation of bone development (β = -0.0036, per 1 point 
      increase in the score; P = 5.6 × 10(-8)). Higher paternal HEI-2015 score was 
      related to lower methylation at CpG site (cg22431767), located near cell 
      signaling gene LUZP1 (β = -0.0022, per 1 point increase in the score, P = 4.1 × 
      10(-8)). There were no associations with parental E-DII and DASH scores, and no 
      evidence of major effects on biomarkers of aging. CONCLUSIONS: Parental dietary 
      quality in the prenatal period, evaluated by the HEI-2015, may influence 
      offspring DNAm during childhood. Further research to improve our understanding of 
      parental nutritional programming is warranted. J Nutr 2023;xx:xx-xx.

AB  - Sleep complaints and cannabis use are common among University students and are 
      related to detrimental effects on health. The aim of this study was to explore 
      their association. This cross-sectional study based on the i-Share e-cohort 
      included French students between 18 and 30 years old (n = 14,787). Frequency of 
      cannabis use was categorized into daily, weekly, monthly, and never/rarely use. 
      Sleep complaints were defined using four items (i.e., insomnia, sleepiness, poor 
      sleep quality, and sleep deprivation). In the whole sample (mean age: 20.4 years, 
      75.5% of females), 22.7% had insomnia, 18.3% had sleepiness, 22.4% had poor sleep 
      quality, 52.5% had sleep deprivation, and 5.8% used cannabis weekly or daily. 
      After adjustment, the likelihood of insomnia was significantly higher by 45% in 
      cannabis users compared to non-users. The estimates steadily increased with 
      frequency of use, reaching a 2.0-fold higher likelihood of insomnia in daily 
      users compared to never/rarely users. Results were similar for the other sleep 
      complaints. These findings provide support for an association between cannabis 
      use and sleep complaints, particularly insomnia, among University students. 
      Though direction and causality cannot be established in this setting, these 
      results suggest warning students and health professionals about the association 
      between cannabis use and sleep complaints.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There have been sporadic reports of ischemic spinal cord injury (SCI) 
      during venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) support. The 
      authors observed a troubling pattern of this catastrophic complication and 
      evaluated the potential mechanisms of SCI related to ECMO. DESIGN: This study was 
      a case series. SETTING: This study was performed at a single institution in a 
      University setting. PARTICIPANTS: Patients requiring prolonged VA-ECMO were 
      included. INTERVENTIONS: No interventions were done. This was an observational 
      study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Four hypotheses of etiology were 
      considered: (1) hypercoagulable state/thromboembolism, (2) regional 
      hypoxia/hypocarbia, (3) hyperperfusion and spinal cord edema, and (4) mechanical 
      coverage of spinal arteries. The SCI involved the lower thoracic (T7-T12 level) 
      spinal cord to the cauda equina in all patients. Seven out of 132 (5.3%) patients 
      with prolonged VA-ECMO support developed SCI. The median time from ECMO 
      cannulation to SCI was 7 (range: 6-17) days.There was no evidence of embolic SCI 
      or extended regional hypoxia or hypocarbia. A unilateral, internal iliac artery 
      was covered by the arterial cannula in 6/7 86%) patients, but flow into the 
      internal iliac was demonstrated on imaging in all available patients. The median 
      total flow (ECMO + intrinsic cardiac output) was 8.5 L/min (LPM), and indexed 
      flow was 4.1 LPM/m(2). The median central venous oxygen saturation was 88%, and 
      intracranial pressure was measured at 30 mmHg in one patient, suggestive of 
      hyperperfusion and spinal cord edema. CONCLUSIONS: An SCI is a serious 
      complication of extended peripheral VA-ECMO support. Its etiology remains 
      uncertain, but the authors' preliminary data suggested that spinal cord edema 
      from hyperperfusion or venous congestion could contribute.

TI  - A Matching-adjusted Indirect Comparison of Nivolumab Plus Cabozantinib Versus 
      Pembrolizumab Plus Axitinib in Patients with Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.
LID - S2588-9311(23)00031-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.euo.2023.01.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The comparative efficacy and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
      outcomes of nivolumab plus cabozantinib versus pembrolizumab plus axitinib as 
      first-line treatments for advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) have not been 
      assessed in head-to-head trials. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and HRQoL 
      outcomes of nivolumab plus cabozantinib versus pembrolizumab plus axitinib. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patient-level data for nivolumab plus 
      cabozantinib from the CheckMate 9ER trial and published data for pembrolizumab 
      plus axitinib from the KEYNOTE-426 trial were used. CheckMate 9ER data were 
      reweighted to match the key baseline characteristics as reported in KEYNOTE-426. 
      INTERVENTION: Nivolumab (240 mg every 2 wk) plus cabozantinib (40 mg once daily) 
      and pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 wk) plus axitinib (5 mg twice daily, 
      initially). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Hazard ratios (HRs) 
      for progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, overall survival (OS), 
      and deterioration in HRQoL were assessed using weighted Cox proportional-hazard 
      models, with sunitinib as a common anchor. Objective response rates (ORRs) and 
      changes in HRQoL scores from baseline were assessed as difference-in-differences 
      for the two treatments relative to sunitinib. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: After 
      balancing patient characteristics between the trials, nivolumab plus cabozantinib 
      was associated with significantly improved PFS (HR [95% confidence interval {CI}] 
      0.70 [0.53-0.93]; p = 0.01) and a significantly decreased risk of confirmed 
      deterioration in HRQoL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom 
      Index-Disease-related Symptoms: HR [95% CI] 0.48 [0.34-0.69]) versus 
      pembrolizumab plus axitinib. OS was similar between treatments (HR [95% CI] 0.99 
      [0.67-1.44]; p = 0.94). Nivolumab plus cabozantinib was associated with 
      numerically greater ORRs (difference-in-difference [95% CI] 8.4% [-1.7 to 18.4]; 
      p = 0.10) and longer duration of response (HR [95% CI] 0.79 [0.47-1.31]; 
      p = 0.36) than pembrolizumab plus axitinib. Comparative studies using data with a 
      longer duration of follow-up are warranted. CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab plus 
      cabozantinib significantly improved PFS and HRQoL compared with pembrolizumab 
      plus axitinib as first-line treatment for aRCC. PATIENT SUMMARY: This study was 
      conducted to indirectly compare the results of two immunotherapy-based 
      combinations-nivolumab plus cabozantinib versus pembrolizumab plus axitinib-for 
      patients who have not received any treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma. 
      Patients who received nivolumab plus cabozantinib had a significant improvement 
      in the length of time without worsening of their disease and in their perceived 
      physical and mental health compared with pembrolizumab plus axitinib; patients 
      remained alive for a similar length of time from the start of either treatment. 
      This analysis further adds to our current knowledge of the relative benefits of 
      these two treatment regimens and will help with physician and patient treatment 
      decisions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies of frailty in primary health care (PHC) using 
      frailty indexes are scarce. Frail-VIG index assesses the level of frailty through 
      a multidimensional approach. The main objective was to investigate the convergent 
      and discriminative validity of the frail-VIG index with respect to Short Physical 
      Performance Battery (SPPB) in general population ≥ 70 years. POPULATION, 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional study. We included 416 
      non-institutionalized patients aged 70 years or over from two lists of general 
      practitioners in a semi-urban healthcare center. Main variables were: frail-VIG 
      index and SPPB. RESULTS: The value of the area under the ROC curve of frail-VIG 
      index respect SPPB < 7 was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76-0.86). Pearson's correlation 
      coefficient was -0.59 (95% CI: -0.524 to -0.649). The mean of frail-VIG index in 
      those classified as not frail by SPPB < 7 was 0.103 (95% CI: 0.094-0.112) and in 
      the frail was 0.242 (95% CI: 0.215-0.269). We obtained significant differences in 
      the mean and distribution of the SPPB according to the frail-VIG index 
      categories. The frailty prevalence according to the frail-VIG index was 29.3% 
      (95% CI: 25.2-33.9), initial 19%, intermediate 7.5% and advanced 2.9%. There were 
      frailty people by frail-VIG index and not by SPPB < 7 the 10.4%; on the contrary 
      the 9.6%, the mean of affected domains of frail-VIG index was 3.9 and 2.2, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The frail-VIG index presents adequate convergent and 
      discriminative validity with respect to the SPPB that supports the use in PHC. 
      There is a 20% of participants classified as frail in a discordant way, who 
      presents a different profile.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) as well as postoperative 
      biliary fistula (POBF) are considered the main source of postoperative morbidity 
      and mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). However, little is known about 
      the incidence and complications of combined POPF/POBF compared to isolated POPF 
      or POBF. METHODS: This single-center study investigated retrospectively the 
      incidence and postoperative outcome of combined POPF/POBF compared to isolated 
      fistulas following PD in a tertiary German pancreatic center between 2009 and 
      2018. RESULTS: A total of 678 patients underwent PD for benign and malignant 
      periampullary lesions. Combined fistulas occurred in 6%, isolated POPF in 16%, 
      and isolated POBF in 2%. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and chronic 
      pancreatitis had a protective effect on the occurrence of combined fistulas, 
      whereas serous cystadenoma and pancreatic metastasis were risk factors. Morbidity 
      (Grade C fistula, post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage, revisional surgery) and 
      mortality was significantly higher in patients with combined fistulas than in 
      those with isolated fistula. Moreover, the duration of ICU stay was longer. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A combined POPF/POBF is associated with a significant increase of 
      morbidity and mortality compared to isolated fistulas after PD. Early surgical 
      revision in these patients may improve the postoperative survival rate.

AB  - During adolescence and puberty, alterations in pain, both experimental and 
      clinical, are observed. In addition, adolescents undergo extensive 
      biopsychosocial changes as they transition from childhood to adulthood. However, 
      a better understanding of how the biopsychosocial changes during adolescence 
      impact pain is needed to improve pain management and develop targeted pain 
      interventions for adolescents. This review synthesizes the literature on 
      alterations in pain during adolescence in humans, describes the potential 
      biopsychosocial factors impacting pain during adolescence, and suggests future 
      research directions to advance the understanding of the impact of adolescent 
      development on pain.

AB  - Iron overload in neurodegenerative diseases is well established but of uncertain 
      significance. In a recent article, Ryan et al. reveal that microglia are 
      especially vulnerable to iron overload-induced ferroptosis. Their evidence for 
      microglial ferroptosis in clinical specimens indicates that ferroptosis 
      inhibitors may hold therapeutic promise for these diseases.

LID - 10.1016/j.ajodo.2022.11.012 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Regarding the key role of the maxillary canine in dynamic occlusion 
      and smile esthetics, this study investigated the relation between smile esthetics 
      and maxillary canine torque and vertical position from the viewpoint of 
      orthodontists, general dentists, and laypersons. METHODS: In this descriptive 
      cross-sectional study, the close-up smile images have been changed using Adobe 
      Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, Calif). Then, groups of 21 orthodontists, 20 
      general dentists, and 33 laypersons evaluated the smile attractiveness of the 
      images using a digital version of a visual analog scale. Statistical analysis was 
      performed using SPSS software (version 25; IBM, Armonk, Calif) and Shapiro-Wilk, 
      analysis of variance, and Tukey post-hoc statistical tests. The significance 
      level was set at 0.05. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean 
      score between the 3 groups of observers regarding the changes in the canine 
      vertical position in none of the variations (P >0.05). Regarding variations in 
      torque, there was a significant difference between the 3 groups of observers in 
      the bilateral 5° torque change. (P = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral changes in 
      the vertical position had lower scores, which shows that symmetry is very 
      important in smile esthetics. In addition, laypersons did not find torque changes 
      ranging between -15° to 15° a significant factor in smile esthetics. Overall, 
      some adherence to these values will be acceptable in dental treatments.

LID - 10.1016/j.ajodo.2022.10.028 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the further development 
      of the lateral incisor and its associated periodontium adjacent to the treated 
      labial inversely impacted maxillary central incisor. METHODS: We enrolled 23 
      participants (average age, 8.24 ± 1.43 years) undergoing a mean follow-up period 
      of 31.10 ± 13.05 months. Each participant had an unimpacted lateral incisor and a 
      successfully treated unilateral labial inversely impacted maxillary central 
      incisor. The contralateral lateral incisors served as controls. Cone-beam 
      computed tomography data were available for treatment completion and follow-up 
      stages. The variables (including root length, dental age, root canal width, 
      root-crown angulation, and alveolar bone loss and thickness) were evaluated with 
      Dolphin Imaging software (version 11.95; Dolphin Imaging and Management 
      Solutions, Chatsworth, Calif). RESULTS: At the follow-up stage, the lateral 
      incisors in the impacted side had significantly longer root lengths, smaller root 
      canal widths, and thinner labial bone widths at the apex than at the 
      posttreatment stage (P <0.001, P = 0.036, and P = 0.001, respectively). A 
      significant lateral incisor root length reduction was noted when comparing the 
      impacted and contralateral sides, although no variation was observed in root 
      canal width. Similarly, crown-root angulation of the lateral incisor on the 
      impacted side was significantly larger than that of the contralateral lateral 
      incisor. The lateral incisor on the impacted side also had thicker labial and 
      thinner lingual bone widths at the apex than the contralateral lateral incisor. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The lateral incisor adjacent to the successfully treated labial 
      inversely impacted maxillary central incisor showed continuous growth during 
      follow-up stages, exhibiting a similar morphology and alveolar bone quality but 
      shorter root length, larger root angulation, and thinner lingual bone width at 
      the apex than those of the contralateral lateral incisors.

LID - 10.1016/j.ajodo.2022.10.023 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This observational study investigated the relationship between 
      malocclusion and smiling. METHODS: Adolescents and young adults (n = 72; aged 
      16-25 years) were identified according to their Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI) and 
      allocated to 3 groups: (1) malocclusion group (n = 24; DAI ≥31), (2) retention 
      group (n = 24; pretreatment DAI ≥31) with a prior malocclusion that had been 
      corrected by orthodontic treatment, (3) control group with no-to-minor 
      malocclusion (n = 24; DAI ≤25). Participants were requested to watch an amusing 
      video. Based on the Facial Action Coding System, automated pattern recognition 
      was used to detect smile episodes and assess their frequency, duration, 
      genuineness, intensity, and extent of tooth show. Demographics, Big Five 
      personality dimensions, and self-perceived smile esthetics-related quality of 
      life were collected from all participants via questionnaires. Data were analyzed 
      by mixed-model analysis and adjusted for possible confounders. RESULTS: Patients 
      from the malocclusion and retention groups smiled significantly less than 
      participants from the control group, with the duration of smiles and smiling time 
      being around half those of control subjects. Smile genuineness, smile intensity, 
      and teeth shown did not differ across groups. Personality traits did not differ 
      significantly among the 3 groups, whereas the malocclusion group scored around 
      30% less for dental self-confidence than the other 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients with severe malocclusion tend to smile less, but the features of their 
      smiles are similar to those without malocclusion. A lower propensity to smile in 
      patients with a corrected malocclusion may persist after orthodontic treatment.

AB  - Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that needs to be well controlled to 
      avoid compromising patients' quality of life. In the paediatric population, the 
      role of caregivers is essential in this process. Moreover, adequate asthma 
      control is integral to a child's emotional well-being and to improving the 
      child's ability to participate fully in family and social life. One of the main 
      reasons for uncontrolled asthma is low adherence to treatment, by patients and 
      caregivers. Identifying factors mediating the involvement and participation of 
      caregivers through evaluations of caregivers' sense of coherence can help in the 
      adoption of strategies aimed at effectively directing adherence behaviour through 
      educational and motivational interventions. The goal of this review article is to 
      provide an overview of the sense of coherence as a construct of Antonovsky's 
      salutogenic theory, and to identify its role as a key piece in the successful 
      management of asthma in children.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Dental cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy manufactured by 
      selective laser melting (SLM) is not recommended for clinical applications before 
      annealing because of excessive residual stress. However, limited information is 
      available regarding the relationship between annealing temperature and the 
      metal-ceramic bond properties of SLM Co-Cr alloys. PURPOSE: The purpose of this 
      in vitro study was to investigate the effects of annealing temperature on the 
      metal-ceramic bond properties of SLM Co-Cr alloys. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four 
      groups with different annealing temperatures (850 °C; 950 °C; 1050 °C; 1150 °C) 
      were prepared by using SLM techniques. Bond strengths were measured by using a 
      3-point bend test; subsequently, debonded surface morphologies and elements were 
      assessed by using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with 
      energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The area fraction of adherence 
      porcelain (AFAP) value was introduced to analyze fracture characteristics. 
      Microstructural and interfacial characteristics were characterized by SEM/EDS and 
      X-ray diffraction analysis. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) test was 
      used to analyze thermal matching. A 1-way ANOVA and the Tukey honestly 
      significant difference tests were used to analyze bond strengths and AFAP values 
      statistically (α=.05). RESULTS: The mean ±standard deviation values of the 
      metal-ceramic bond strengths were 40.68 ±4.34 MPa for the 850 °C group, 37.54 
      ±5.34 MPa for the 950 °C group, 45.97 ±2.18 MPa for the 1050 °C group, and 50.79 
      ±1.79 MPa for the 1150 °C group. Significant differences (P<.05) were observed 
      among all groups. Debonded surfaces and AFAP analysis displayed a mixed fracture 
      mode of adhesive and cohesive fracture, and 1150 °C-annealing specimens exhibited 
      better fracture characteristics close to cohesive fractures. As the temperature 
      increased, native oxide film thicknesses remained unchanged; the 850 °C group had 
      the thinnest diffusion layer, while the other 3 groups had similar thicknesses. 
      Although the 1050 °C and 1150 °C groups displayed higher CTE values, their 
      microstructures were more conducive to atomic diffusion and improved chemical 
      bonding. Microstructure analysis found that ε phase and second-phase precipitates 
      jointly affected metal-ceramic bond strength. CONCLUSIONS: Annealing temperatures 
      affected the metal-ceramic bond strengths of SLM Co-Cr porcelain specimens. 1150 
      °C annealing SLM Co-Cr specimens displayed higher bond strengths and improved 
      fracture and interface characteristics among the 4 groups.

TI  - Retinal vessels as a window on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathophysiology: A 
      systematic review.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare fatal motor neuron disease. 
      Although many potential mechanisms have been proposed, the pathophysiology of the 
      disease remains unknown. Currently available treatments can only delay the 
      progression of the disease and prolong life expectancy by a few months. There is 
      still no definitive cure for ALS, and the development of new treatments is 
      limited by a lack of understanding of the underlying biological processes that 
      trigger and promote neurodegeneration. Several scientific results suggest a 
      neurovascular impairment in ALS providing perspectives for the development of new 
      biomarkers and treatments. In this article, we performed a systematic review 
      using PRISMA guidelines including PubMed, EmBase, GoogleScholar, and Web of 
      Science Core Collection to analyze the scientific literature published between 
      2000 and 2021 discussing the neurocardiovascular involvement and ophthalmologic 
      abnormalities in ALS. In total, 122 articles were included to establish this 
      systematic review. Indeed, microvascular pathology seems to be involved in ALS, 
      affecting all the neurovascular unit components. Retinal changes have also been 
      recently highlighted without significant alteration of the visual pathways. 
      Despite the peripheral location of the retina, it is considered as an extension 
      of the central nervous system (CNS) as it displays similarities to the brain, the 
      inner blood-retinal barrier, and the blood-brain barrier. This suggests that the 
      eye could be considered as a 'window' into the brain in many CNS disorders. Thus, 
      studying ocular manifestations of brain pathologies seems very promising in 
      understanding neurodegenerative disorders, mainly ALS. Optical coherence 
      tomography angiography (OCT-A) could therefore be a powerful approach for 
      exploration of retinal microvascularization allowing to obtain new diagnostic and 
      prognostic biomarkers of ALS.

AB  - AIM: To compare the safety and efficacy between Veress needle insertion and 
      direct trocar insertion in laparoscopic surgeries. METHODS: Relevant clinical 
      trials were retrieved from major databases; Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, 
      PubMed, and SCOPUS. The following outcomes were pooled for analysis: failed 
      entry, extraperitoneal insufflation, vascular lesion, omental lesion and visceral 
      lesion, site bleeding, reintervention, subcutaneous emphysema, solid organ 
      lesion, and infection of the trocar site. A fixed-effects model was used to 
      analyze homogeneous outcomes, whereas random-effects models were used to analyze 
      heterogeneous outcomes. RESULTS: We included a total of twelve clinical trials. 
      The pooled analysis showed that the Veress needle was accompanied by a 
      significant increase in the incidences of extraperitoneal insufflation 
      (RR = 0.204; 95% Cl [0.136, 0.307], P=0.001), omental lesion (RR=0.444 95% Cl 
      [0.239, 0.825], P=0.01), and failed entry (RR=0.169 95% Cl [0.101, 0.284], 
      P=0.001). There is no significant difference between both cohort regarding the 
      vascular lesion (RR=0.847 95% Cl [0.259, 2.777), P=0.7), infection of the trocar 
      site (RR=0.583 95%Cl [0.106, 3.216], P=0.5, and visceral lesion (RR=1.308 95% Cl 
      [0.314, 5.438], P=0.7. CONCLUSION: The DTI was accompanied by a significantly 
      lower incidence of complications such as extraperitoneal insufflation, failed 
      entry, omental lesion, and subcutaneous emphysema. On the other hand, both 
      cohorts showed similar results regarding; vascular lesions, visceral lesions, 
      reintervention, site bleeding, and solid organ lesion.

TI  - Measures of carbohydrate quality and their association with diet quality and 
      cardiometabolic health outcomes in Singapore middle-aged and older adults.
LID - S0939-4753(23)00019-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.numecd.2023.01.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Carbohydrate quality may play a key role in cardiometabolic 
      health and disease risk. This study aimed to assess the dietary carbohydrate 
      quality of the free-living middle-aged and older adults in Singapore, and its 
      association with overall diet quality and cardiometabolic health. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: This cross-sectional study examined the diet and cardiometabolic disease 
      risk indicators of middle-aged and older adults in Singapore (n = 104). Dietary 
      carbohydrate quality was assessed as the pass and fail rate of the population to 
      four measures of carbohydrate quality: (i) dietary fiber recommended daily 
      allowance (RDA), (ii) whole-grain recommendation, (iii) free sugar 
      recommendation, and (iv) carbohydrate metrics. The association between each 
      carbohydrate quality measure and diet quality, as well as cardiometabolic health, 
      was assessed. Except for free sugar recommendation, the carbohydrate quality of 
      the population was found to be poor with a low adherence (20-36%) to three 
      measures. Subjects meeting these measures had generally higher intakes of fiber, 
      protein, and most micronutrients compared with subjects who failed. Meeting 
      different variants of the carbohydrate metrics was associated with 60% lower odds 
      of pre-hypertensive blood pressure (p = 0.037; p = 0.047), and meeting the 
      dietary fiber RDA was associated with lower waist circumference (p = 0.021). 
      CONCLUSION: An improvement in carbohydrate quality is warranted among free-living 
      middle-aged and older adults in Singapore. Not all measures of carbohydrate 
      quality were equally effective in preserving overall diet quality; the 
      carbohydrate metrics and dietary fiber RDA can be identified as effective 
      measures in relation to cardiometabolic disease risk. CLINICAL TRIAL

LID - 10.1016/j.numecd.2022.12.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic exposure to hyperglycemia is a significant risk 
      factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Advanced glycation end products (AGES) 
      result from multiple sugar-dependent reactions interacting with proteins and 
      their receptors, generating endothelial dysfunction and CVD. However, there is 
      little epidemiological data about its impact on CVD risk. We aimed to assess the 
      association between circulating AGES and CVD risk in the Mexican population. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We used longitudinal data from waves 2004-2006 and 2010-2012 
      of 1195 participants from the Health Workers Cohort Study. Circulating AGES were 
      assessed by radioimmunoassay, and cardiovascular risk (CVR) was computed with the 
      Framingham risk score. Linear and logistic fixed-effects regression models were 
      used to assess the interest association, adjusting for confounding factors. An 
      increase in 200 μU/ml of AGES was associated with a 0.18% increased risk of CVD 
      (95% CI 0.05-0.31%). After adjusting for physical activity and smoking status, 
      individuals who increased their AGES category had higher odds of middle-high CVR 
      (low to medium AGES: OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.11-3.20; low to high AGES: OR 2.61, 95% CI 
      1.51-4.50). The associations remained statistically significant when we further 
      adjusted for insulin resistance, dietary intake of AGES, and total daily calorie 
      intake. CONCLUSION: Our data show that circulating AGES are associated with the 
      Framingham CVD risk score, independently of other major risk factors for CVD in 
      the Mexican population.

TI  - Critical evaluation of the questionnaires assessing adherence to the 
      Mediterranean diet that are based on servings.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Mediterranean Diet (MD) is characterized by a high 
      intake of vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, and olive oil, and moderate fish, 
      dairy, and wine intake. A high adherence to MD has been associated with numerous 
      health benefits, including reduced risk of chronic diseases such as 
      cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. The clinical assessment of 
      MD adherence is complicated by the absence of a univocally accepted tool and by 
      the abundance of questionnaires developed to determine adherence, whose 
      reliability and validity is uncertain. In this inter-associative document, we 
      critically evaluated servings-based questionnaires for the assessment of MD 
      adherence, aiming to identify the most valuable tool for the use in clinical 
      practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: For each questionnaire, we analyzed the structure, 
      evidence on health-related outcomes and agreement with the recommendations of MD. 
      We found that most questionnaires do not accurately reflect the principles of MD 
      in terms of the food groups and their optimal consumption frequency. 
      Additionally, the comparison of questionnaires revealed low agreement and some 
      concerns with regard to the scoring assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Among the available 
      questionnaires, we suggest the use of the 15-Items Pyramid based Mediterranean 
      Diet Score (PyrMDS), which is the one with fewer flaws and a strong supporting 
      body of theoretical and scientific evidence. The use of the PyrMDS may facilitate 
      the assessment of MD adherence in clinical practice, which is instrumental in 
      reducing the risk of non-communicable chronic diseases.

TI  - Predictive ability of traditional and novel anthropometric measurement indices 
      for cardio-metabolic diseases in Chinese adults: China Health and Nutrition 
      Survey (CHNS) cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cardio-metabolic diseases has been shown to be strongly 
      associated with obesity. The aim of this study was to compare the predictive 
      value of traditional and novel anthropometric measurement indices for 
      cardio-metabolic diseases risk and evaluate whether new indicators can provide 
      important information in addition to traditional indicators. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data were obtained for this study. 
      Baseline information for healthy participants was gathered from 1997 to 2004. The 
      incidence of cardio-metabolic diseases was collected from 2009 to 2015 for cohort 
      analysis. The predictive ability of each index for the risk of cardio-metabolic 
      diseases was evaluated with time-dependent ROC analysis. Body mass index (BMI) 
      showed the greatest predictive ability for cardio-metabolic disease incidence 
      among all traditional and novel indices (Harrell's C statistic (95% CI): 0.7386 
      (0.7266-0.7507) for hypertension, 0.7496 (0.7285-0.7706) for diabetes, 0.7895 
      (0.7593-0.8196) for stroke and 0.7581 (0.7193-0.7969) for myocardial infarction). 
      The addition of novel indices separately into the BMI model did not improve the 
      predictive ability. Novel anthropometric measurement indices such as a body shape 
      index (ABSI), abdominal volume index (AVI) and triponderal mass index (TMI), had 
      a certain prediction ability for adults with BMI <24 kg/m(2) compared to those 
      with BMI ≥24 kg/m(2). CONCLUSION: No strong evidence supports novel 
      anthropometric measurement indices were better than BMI in the prediction of 
      cardio-metabolic diseases incidence among Chinese adults. Novel anthropometric 
      measurement indices, mainly for abdominal obesity, may have a high predictive 
      effect for adults with BMI <24 kg/m(2).
